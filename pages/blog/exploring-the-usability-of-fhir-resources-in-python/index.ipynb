    "# Exploring the Usability of FHIR Resources in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) has emerged as a powerful specification for exchanging healthcare information electronically. In the realm of Python development, the `fhir.resources` module stands out as a comprehensive toolkit, facilitating the manipulation of FHIR resources with ease. In this technical blog, we'll delve into the features and usability of this module, exploring its capabilities, installation, and advanced functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of FHIR Resources Module\n",
    "\n",
    "The `fhir.resources` module is designed to provide a seamless experience for working with FHIR resources in Python. Here are some key highlights:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modularity**: FHIR adopts a modular approach with a set of resources representing different healthcare data types (e.g., patients, observations, diagnoses). This modular design allows for flexibility and extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Powered by Pydantic**: Leveraging the power of Pydantic, the module ensures faster performance and includes optional support for orjson, enhancing overall efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Compatibility with ORM**: The module seamlessly integrates with Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), making it compatible with various database systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **FHIR Version Support**: The module supports FHIR Release 5 (version 5.0.0) by default, with previous versions available as sub-packages. This ensures backward compatibility and smooth transitions between releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Easy Installation**: A simple `pip install fhir.resources` or `easy_install fhir.resources` is sufficient for installation. For the development version, cloning the GitHub repository is recommended.\n",
