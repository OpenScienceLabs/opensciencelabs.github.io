## Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)

Open Science Labs (OSL) is a community that offers an open space to share, learn
and teach topics related to Open Science and Computational Technologies to
people from Latin America or any part of the world.

DEI is a very important aspect of our community and we really care about that.

In this section we can find our initial DEI declaration.
