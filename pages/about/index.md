# About Open Science Labs

Open Science Labs (OSL) is a unified, no-fee commons where people and open
projects grow together. We exist to turn learning into real-world experience,
and open collaboration into visible, lasting social and technological impact.

OSL is for the moments when people feel stuck or unseen—finishing a course and
wondering “now what?”, facing “experience required” walls, or watching a project
stall without contributors. We bring belonging, momentum, and recognition by
helping contributors ship meaningful work alongside supportive peers and
mentors.

## Our Gift

We envision a world where opportunity is not reserved for the few—where
newcomers and early-stage projects, regardless of background or location, enter
an open, supportive commons. In this environment, anyone aligned with our values
grows through learning and contribution, and together we turn open science and
open technology into tangible social and technological impact.

## Our Promise

**OSL empowers people and projects to grow together**—turning learning into
real-world experience, careers with purpose, and open collaboration into lasting
social and technological impact.

## What We Stand For

- **Growth:** learning by doing, with steady progress and real outcomes.
- **Belonging:** a friendly, supportive place to contribute and be seen.
- **Mentorship:** trust, care, and guidance that builds confidence and skill.
- **Collaboration:** collective momentum across cultures, disciplines, and time
  zones.
- **Empowerment:** pathways that help people believe in their potential.
- **Purpose:** work that matters—socially, technically, and scientifically.
- **Gratitude & recognition:** celebrating contributions and making impact
  visible.

## What We Do

- **Project Incubation:** we support mission-driven open projects with a path
  from idea → contributors → releases → adoption.
- **Internships & structured onboarding:** we help newcomers build credible,
  portfolio-ready experience through real work on real projects.
- **Mentorship network:** multi-level mentoring that supports both contributors
  and maintainers over time.
- **Programs & partnerships:** we collaborate with institutions and communities
  to grow open ecosystems (including participating in initiatives like GSoC when
  applicable).
- **Visibility & storytelling:** we publish and amplify work through posts,
  updates, and public artifacts so contributors and projects get recognized.
- **Community space:** our Discord is where people meet, ask, build, review, and
  ship—together.

## Who OSL Is For

- **Newcomers** who want a real path from learning to meaningful experience.
- **Maintainers** who need contributors, structure, and long-term momentum.
- **Researchers and developers** who want to build openly, reproducibly, and
  with purpose.
- **Communities across geographies** looking for a welcoming place to grow.

## Global, by design

OSL is shaped by contributors from many parts of the world. We prioritize
cross-geography collaboration so that opportunity, mentorship, and visibility
are not limited by location.
