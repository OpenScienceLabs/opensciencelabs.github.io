# Open Source Internship Program

This document provides guidelines for both open-source project maintainers and
internship candidates at Open Science Labs (OSL).

## Overview

OSL is committed to fostering innovation and growth within the open science and
open source communities. This internship program embodies that commitment by
providing a dynamic and supportive environment for contributors at all
levelsâ€”from students just stepping into the world of open-source to
professionals looking to refine their skills.

This program operates in partnership with
[The GRAPH Network](https://thegraphnetwork.org), enhancing our reach and impact
across the scientific community.

## Program Structure

Modeled after Google Summer of Code, our program offers the following key
features:

- **Open Participation**: Open to everyone from students to professionals, we
  embrace diversity in knowledge and experience. Applicants should submit their
  project ideas directly to the mentors via email.
- **Flexible Commitment**: Participants are expected to contribute a minimum of
  20 hours per week, allowing for substantial contribution while accommodating
  personal schedules.
- **Rolling Applications**: We accept applications on a rolling basis, providing
  flexibility to accommodate participants' timing and availability. This ensures
  opportunities are accessible year-round, allowing you to engage when it suits
  you best.
- **Final Presentation**: Participants will present their projects at the
  program's conclusion, enhancing their public speaking and technical
  communication skills.
- **Non-Monetary Rewards**: While the internship does not provide financial
  compensation, it offers invaluable experience, mentorship, networking
  opportunities, and the satisfaction of contributing to significant open-source
  projects.

## For Intern Candidates

Prospective interns must meet the following criteria:

- **English Proficiency**: Effective communication in English is required for
  collaboration within the program.
