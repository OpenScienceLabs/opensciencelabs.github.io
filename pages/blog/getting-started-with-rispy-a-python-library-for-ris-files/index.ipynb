    "# Blog Post: Getting Started with rispy - A Python Library for RIS Files\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of academic research and literature management, dealing with bibliographic data is a common task. One of the formats used for exporting and handling such data is RIS (Research Information System Format), which is a standardized tag format used by digital libraries. Managing these RIS files can be a daunting task, but thanks to Python libraries like Rispy, this process becomes much more manageable. In this blog post, we'll explore how to use rispy to handle RIS files effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The pronunciation is rispee, like \"crispy\", but without the c.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is rispy?\n",
    "\n",
    "Rispy is a Python library designed to parse and handle bibliographic data in RIS format. Developed by MrTango, it simplifies the process of reading and writing RIS files, making it an indispensable tool for researchers and developers working in academic environments. *rispy* is open-source and can be found on GitHub: [rispy on GitHub](https://github.com/MrTango/rispy).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the usage of Rispy, the first step is to install the library. This can be easily done using pip, Python's package installer. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:"

The objective of this study was to evaluate powdery mildew severity in rose cultivar ‘Grand Gala’ in response to organic fertilization and the application of alternative products to disease control. The first experiment was set in a factorial arrangement, with 5 alternative products: spraying with water as a control (PA), lime sulfur (CS), neem oil (ON), mixture of sodium bicarbonate and canola oil (BC) and coffee pyroligneous acid (APC) and 2 organic fertilizers: chicken manure (EA) and biofertilizer based on banana stalk (B). Disease severity was assessed at 0, 15, 30 and 45 days after the treatments. In the second experiment, asymptomatic leaves or with different powdery mildew severity levels were sprayed only once with the same alternative products mentioned above. Severity was assessed at 0, 7 and 14 days. The organic fertilizations did not influence the reduction in powdery mildew severity in rose. At 45 days, APC yielded a greater reduction in disease severity (81.6%), followed by treatments based on BC, ON and CS. Greater reduction in disease severity in experiment 2 occurred in the treatments of BC and CS, followed by APC. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that APC and the BC have the potential to control rose powdery mildew in an organic cultivation system.\""

The face, as a mirror of health status, can reveal symptomatic indications of specific diseases. Thus, the detection of facial abnormalities or atypical features is at up most importance when it comes to medical diagnostics. This survey aims to give an overview of the recent developments in medical diagnostics from facial images based on computer vision methods. Various approaches have been considered to assess facial symptoms and to eventually provide further help to the practitioners. However, the developed tools are still seldom used in clinical practice, since their reliability is still a concern due to the lack of clinical validation of the methodologies and their inadequate applicability. Nonetheless, efforts are being made to provide robust solutions suitable for healthcare environments, by dealing with practical issues such as real-time assessment or patients positioning. This survey provides an updated collection of the most relevant and innovative solutions in facial images analysis. The findings show that with the help of computer vision methods, over 30 medical conditions can be preliminarily diagnosed from the automatic detection of some of their symptoms. Furthermore, future perspectives, such as the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and collecting publicly available databases, are highlighted.\""
