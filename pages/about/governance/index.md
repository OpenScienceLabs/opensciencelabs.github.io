# Open Science Labs Project Governance

This document formalizes the governance structure of Open Science Labs (OSL). It
outlines decision-making processes and the interactions among community members,
including relationships between work supported by for-profit or nonprofit
organizations and open source collaborative development.

## Summary

OSL operates as a community-owned and community-run project. Typically,
decisions are made by the executive director, with support from the
[steering council](https://opensciencelabs.org/about/team/). Responsibility for
specific tasks or areas lies with individual members, who bring issues to the
community's attention for group discussion and decision-making in one of OSL’s
Discord channels. All content and access must relate to open technologies;
references to private technologies or content are prohibited, maintaining an
open and inclusive environment.

## The Organization

Open Science Labs aims to unite people globally to foster an open environment
for teaching, learning, and sharing knowledge about open science and
computational tools. The organization is led by the executive director and
supported by the [steering council](https://opensciencelabs.org/about/team/).
Financial and administrative support is provided by
[The GRAPH Network](https://thegraphnetwork.org) and
[Open Source Collective](https://opencollective.com/osl), which also supports
the OSL Internship Program.

## Affiliated Projects

Affiliated projects are independent in their governance. OSL does not control
these projects but offers suggestions and support to enhance their internal
organization, helping them better support their contributors and users. These
projects are eligible to participate in OSL activities like Internship Programs,
Google Summer of Code, Blog, and Newsletters.

## Incubated Projects

Projects incubated by OSL are released under OSI-approved licenses (BSD, Apache
2.0, MIT, etc.) and developed openly on public GitHub repositories. Contributors
include anyone who has collaborated through code, documentation, design, or
other contributions. The community, comprising all Contributors and Users,
strives for minimal barriers between participants, promoting an open and
transparent environment.

## Incubated Project Governance

Incubated project governance is based on principles of openness, transparency,
active contribution, institutional neutrality, diversity, equity, inclusion, and
education.

### Consensus-based Decision Making

Decisions are generally made by consensus among all interested Contributors,
aiming to incorporate diverse perspectives into the development process. The
consensus process does not necessarily involve voting but allows for vetoes to
ensure serious concerns are considered. Formal vetoes require a clear statement
and explanation from the vetoer.

### Steering Council

The Steering Council, composed of significant contributors, oversees the
project's technical and community health. The council facilitates
decision-making, helps resolve conflicts, and may intervene in governance if
necessary to maintain the project’s welfare.

#### Council Decision Making

When formal decisions are necessary, the council employs a consensus model
similar to that used by the Apache Foundation. This model uses a combination of
judgement and community discussion, with formal voting held open for sufficient
time to allow all council members to participate.

#### Council Membership

Council members are nominated based on their substantial and sustained
contributions. Inactivity for over six months may lead to removal from the
council, although re-nomination is always possible. The council also handles
conflicts of interest and private communications, maintaining transparency as
much as possible.

#### Institutional Partners and Funding

While OSL Incubated Projects is led by their authors, and core contributors, who
compose the Steering Council, funding and support from Institutional Partners
are acknowledged and facilitated. These partners can influence the project
through their council members but do not control the project. Partners must
align with OSL’s values and contribute through funding, contributing personnel,
or other means specified in partnership agreements.
