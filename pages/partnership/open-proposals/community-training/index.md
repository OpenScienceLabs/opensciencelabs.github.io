# Project: Community Training

## Executive Summary

Community Training is an initiative designed to create a centralized online
platform for training and certifying community facilitators. The program will
offer courses on topics such as Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI),
effective communication, project management, inclusive language, and basic
pedagogical principles. Successful participants will earn digital badges
displayed on their public profiles. This initiative aims to enhance community
management by equipping facilitators with the skills needed to support their
communities effectively.

## Background / Problem Statement

Many digital communities lack a standardized resource for training facilitators
in effective management and communication. Without proper guidance, those in
leadership roles, such as project mentors and study group coordinators, may
struggle to address conflicts or guide community interactions. Community
Training addresses this gap by providing a structured program that ensures
facilitators are well-prepared to manage community issues and support
collaborative growth.

## Objectives and Goals

- **Objective:** Establish an online training platform to train and certify
  community facilitators.
- **Goals:**
  - Develop and deliver courses covering topcis such as: DEI, communication,
    project management, inclusive language, and foundational pedagogical
    methods.
  - Implement an assessment system where successful participants earn digital
    badges.
  - Create a public profile system for certified facilitators to showcase their
    credentials.
  - Enhance overall community management through continuous learning and
    mentorship.

## Scope and Deliverables

- **Scope:**
  - Design and develop an online platform tailored for community facilitator
    training.
  - Create curriculum content for at least five core courses.
  - Integrate an examination system and digital badge issuance mechanism.
  - Establish a public profile system for displaying certifications.
- **Deliverables:**
  - A fully functional online platform with user registration and course
    modules.
  - Comprehensive course materials and exam questions for each module.
  - Automated digital badge generation and profile integration.
  - Documentation and guidelines for both facilitators and administrators.

## Approach / Methodology

The project will be implemented in three phases:

1. **Planning and Design (Months 1-2):** Define the curriculum, design the
   platform architecture, and establish the certification process.
2. **Development and Implementation (Months 3-5):** Build the online platform,
   develop course content, integrate the exam and badge systems, and conduct
   pilot testing.
3. **Evaluation and Rollout (Month 6):** Gather feedback from pilot users,
   refine course content and the platform, and officially launch Community
   Training.

An agile methodology will be applied throughout to allow for regular reviews and
continuous improvements.

## Timeline / Project Schedule

- **Phase 1: Planning and Design (Months 1-2)**
  - Finalize curriculum and platform design.
- **Phase 2: Development and Implementation (Months 3-5)**
  - Develop the online platform and integrate course modules.
  - Launch a pilot test with a select group of facilitators.
- **Phase 3: Evaluation and Rollout (Month 6)**
  - Collect feedback, refine the platform and content, and officially launch
    Community Training.

## Budget and Resource Requirements

- **Platform Development:** $20,000
- **Content Creation & Course Development:** $10,000
- **Pilot Testing & Evaluation:** $2,000
- **Fiscal Sponsor Overhead (10%):** $3,200 **Total Estimated Budget:** $35,200

Additional resources include technical staff for platform development, subject
matter experts for course content, and administrative support for coordination
and outreach.

## Risk Management

- **Content Delays:** Set clear deadlines and allocate dedicated resources for
  course development.
- **Low Enrollment:** Implement targeted outreach strategies and leverage
  existing community networks.
- **Technical Challenges:** Conduct thorough testing during the pilot phase and
  allocate resources for rapid troubleshooting.
- **Insufficient Funding:** Seek additional funding or partnerships early to
  secure adequate resources.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

Community Training aims to address a critical gap in digital community
management by providing structured training and certification for facilitators.
This initiative is expected to improve community support and foster a more
effective, inclusive digital ecosystem. We invite potential partners to discuss
this proposal further and explore collaborative opportunities to support the
project's development and long-term success.
