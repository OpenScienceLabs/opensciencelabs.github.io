# About

Open science labs is a community that aims to gather people from all parts of
the world, specially from latin america countries and create an open space for
teaching, learning and sharing topics around open science and computational
tools. An english group is very important in this context because it increases
the possibilities of collaboration in open projects.

## Community

We are using discord to organize our community. There you can decide which group
you want to join, for example python, c++, compilers, open science, devops,
languages (English, Spanish) , etc.

Also, everyone is more than welcome to propose a study-group. If you want to
study a specific topic, and want to gather more people to study that with you,
we encourage you to propose a study-group.

If you want to give a talk or tutorial about a specific topic, raise your voice
in the channel #comm-general and we will be more than happy to help you to hold
this event on discord.

## Collaborate!

If you want to join us, apply to be a volunteer here.
