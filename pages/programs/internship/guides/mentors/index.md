# Open Science Labs Mentor Guide

The Open Science Labs Mentor Guide is a consolidated resource designed to guide
potential mentoring organizations through the proposal and application process,
and to support approved mentors in fostering intern development. From project
submission to nurturing intern growth, and facilitating their successful
contributions to open source, this guide outlines the key steps and best
practices to ensure a rewarding mentorship experience in our community-driven
programs.

## Part I: Applying to Become a Mentoring Organization

As a prospective mentoring organization within Open Science Labs, you have the
opportunity to shape the future of open source by guiding and nurturing new
talent. Your contributions, in the form of project ideas and mentorship, are
crucial to the development of both individual contributors and the larger
community. This section of the guide will walk you through the application
process and help you submit your project proposals effectively.

### Application Process

When the call for mentoring organizations opens, you are encouraged to apply
with a detailed outline of all the project ideas. A 'project' constitutes a
well-defined proposal targeting a specific software, package, or library with
distinct tasks. While there is no limit to the number of projects you can
propose, please note that OSL reserves the right to approve only a subset based
on our capacity and strategic focus. For Cycle 2, tied to GSoC, a maximum of two
projects may be submitted per organization.

**Important Note**: Inclusion in GSoC for Cycle 2 is not a certainty, and OSL
will provide updates on this option once GSoC confirmations are received.

## Part II: Recommendations for Approved Mentors

Congratulations on being selected as a mentor for the OSL
Internship/Apprenticeship Program! You are about to embark on a rewarding
journey of imparting knowledge and facilitating growth. This part of the guide
is crafted to support you in leading an effective mentorship, outlining key
activities and providing practical tips for fostering a successful internship
experience.

### Conducting Effective Mentorship

- **Proposal Guidance**: Assist the intern candidate in drafting a comprehensive
  proposal for the program, detailing expected tasks and outcomes.
- **Regular Meetings**: Schedule consistent meetings (weekly or biweekly) with
  the intern to discuss progress, challenges, and next steps.
- **PR Reviews and Direction**: Regularly review the intern's pull requests to
  ensure they're aligned with the project's direction and maintain progress
  within set timelines.
- **Blog Post Guidance**: Guide the intern in documenting their journey by
  writing biweekly or monthly blog posts on https://opensciencelabs.org,
  highlighting accomplishments and learnings.
- **Timeline Management**: Keep the intern informed of all important dates and
  ensure they complete evaluations on time.
- **Presentation Preparation**: Support the intern in preparing a talk about
  their project, which can be delivered within the OSL community or at relevant
  events.

### Additional Tips

- **Extra Resources**: If an intern is struggling with certain concepts,
  recommend additional study materials to aid their understanding.
- **Technical Advice**: Offer technical insights to enhance the intern's
  performance and productivity, ensuring they contribute high-quality work to
  the project.

Mentoring with OSL is not just about overseeing work; it's about nurturing a new
generation of open source contributors. Your wisdom, experience, and
encouragement will help interns realize their potential and ensure they make a
meaningful impact on the open source community.
