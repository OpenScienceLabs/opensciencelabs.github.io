## Open Source Internships

Open Science Labs (OSL) offers opportunities for enthusiasts who are new to
open-source software development to build their skills through its unpaid
internship program. This resourceful program is designed to enhance each
candidate's familiarity with open-source software tools and best practices. We
encourage all candidates to appreciate and make the most of these opportunities
as we look forward to a productive collaboration.
