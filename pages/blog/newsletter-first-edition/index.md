## News: OSL Receives PSF Grant for MAKIM and ASTx Projects

We're thrilled to announce that the Python Software Foundation (PSF) has granted
funding to two of our key projects: **MAKIM** and **ASTx**. This support will
help accelerate development and enhance the capabilities of these tools. Read on
to learn more about these projects and the impact of the PSF grant.

### About the Python Software Foundation

Founded in March 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF) is a nonprofit
organization dedicated to advancing and promoting the Python programming
language. The PSF supports a wide range of open-source Python projects,
fostering a vibrant and inclusive community.

## Are You a Pythonista? Join the pyOpenSci Fall Festival 2024

Mark your calendars! Our partner is hosting a one-of-a-kind event. The
**pyOpenSci Fall Festival 2024** is an inaugural online meeting of Python, Open
Science, and Open Source enthusiasts set to take place from October 28 to
November 1, 2024.

The event promises to feature insightful talks, essential hands-on workshops,
and office hours with numerous industry experts exchanging ideas and sharing
experiences.

## OSL Projects Development Report

### MAKIM Improvements

**MAKIM** is a YAML-based task automation tool inspired by Make. It offers
structured definitions for tasks and dependencies, supporting conditionals,
arguments, grouping, variables, Jinja2 templating, and environment file
integration.

Makim team has made several recent updates to the project, including the
addition of new features supported by the PSF grant.

- Added support for checking the .makim.yaml structure with a schema definition.
- Added support for matrix variables for tasks.
- Changed from dependencies support to hooks with pre and post run support.
- Fixed text problems and issues in the continuous integration jobs.
- Introduced support for interactive arguments, allowing for more dynamic user
  input.
- Refactored the attribute "shell" to "backend," improving code clarity.
- Updated the configuration for MyPy to ensure better type-checking practices.

### ASTx Improvements

**ASTx** is a language-agnostic expression structure designed primarily for the
ArxLang project. However, it can be utilized by any programming language or
parser to create high-level representations of Abstract Syntax Trees (AST).

ArxLang team has made several developmental improvements to ASTx, including the
addition of new features supported by the PSF grant:

- Added a new import statement feature for improved module management.
- Implemented runtime type checking using Typeguard.
- Enhanced type safety and reliability.
- Improved the development configuration structure, and dependencies.
- Added a transpiler from astx to python
- Added support to complex32 and complex64
- Added support to float16, and float64
- Added support to uint8, uint16, unit32, uint64, uint128

### Sugar and SciCookie Both Have New Updates

**Sugar** and **SciCookie** projects are also receiving updates. The latest PRs on the Sugar repository include:

- Added support for checking the .sugar.yaml structure with a schema definition.
- A fix for the Jinja2 template.
- A refactor of the interface for plugins/extensions that moves the main command
  to the compose group.

On the SciCookie project, SciCookie team has added some feature and
improvements:

- Improved tests and infrastructure.
