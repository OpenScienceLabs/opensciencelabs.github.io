It outlines decision-making processes and the interactions among community members, including relationships between work supported by for-profit or nonprofit organizations and open source collaborative development. Summary # OSL operates as a community-owned and community-run project. Typically, decisions are made by the executive director, with support from the steering council . Responsibility for specific tasks or areas lies with individual members, who bring issues to the community's attention for group discussion and decision-making in one of OSL\u2019s Discord channels. All content and access must relate to open technologies; references to private technologies or content are prohibited, maintaining an open and inclusive environment. The Organization # Open Science Labs aims to unite people globally to foster an open environment for teaching, learning, and sharing knowledge about open science and computational tools. The organization is led by the executive director and supported by the steering council . Financial and administrative support is provided by The GRAPH Network and Open Source Collective , which also supports the OSL Internship Program. Affiliated Projects # Affiliated projects are independent in their governance. OSL does not control these projects but offers suggestions and support to enhance their internal organization, helping them better support their contributors and users. These projects are eligible to participate in OSL activities like Internship Programs, Google Summer of Code, Blog, and Newsletters. Incubated Projects # Projects incubated by OSL are released under OSI-approved licenses (BSD, Apache 2.0, MIT, etc.) and developed openly on public GitHub repositories. Contributors include anyone who has collaborated through code, documentation, design, or other contributions. The community, comprising all Contributors and Users, strives for minimal barriers between participants, promoting an open and transparent environment. Incubated Project Governance # Incubated project governance is based on principles of openness, transparency, active contribution, institutional neutrality, diversity, equity, inclusion, and education. Consensus-based Decision Making # Decisions are generally made by consensus among all interested Contributors, aiming to incorporate diverse perspectives into the development process. The consensus process does not necessarily involve voting but allows for vetoes to ensure serious concerns are considered. Formal vetoes require a clear statement and explanation from the vetoer. Steering Council # The Steering Council, composed of significant contributors, oversees the project's technical and community health. The council facilitates decision-making, helps resolve conflicts, and may intervene in governance if necessary to maintain the project\u2019s welfare. Council Decision Making # When formal decisions are necessary, the council employs a consensus model similar to that used by the Apache Foundation. This model uses a combination of judgement and community discussion, with formal voting held open for sufficient time to allow all council members to participate. Council Membership # Council members are nominated based on their substantial and sustained contributions. Inactivity for over six months may lead to removal from the council, although re-nomination is always possible. The council also handles conflicts of interest and private communications, maintaining transparency as much as possible. Institutional Partners and Funding # While OSL Incubated Projects is led by their authors, and core contributors, who compose the Steering Council, funding and support from Institutional Partners are acknowledged and facilitated. These partners can influence the project through their council members but do not control the project. Partners must align with OSL\u2019s values and contribute through funding, contributing personnel, or other means specified in partnership agreements.

We want to encourage more people to engage in collaborative and open science practices. The tone should be fresh, even in tasks that are a bit more complex to explain, the idea is to encourage those who read us to continue with open science practices. We practice inclusive language. Therefore, we seek the generic use of words that do not indicate any sex or gender in a preferential way: people, participants, who, among others. In the case of having to use a word that denotes sex and gender, we also indicate references to other genders and sexes: /a/e. This applies to both singular and plural. In general, both tone and speech should be respectful and clear. Words that, for cultural reasons, may be misunderstood in other cultures should be avoided. At OSL we are very respectful of other cultures, religious practices, political preferences, sports and, in general, we never address in our articles our personal preferences in any area that may be controversial and uncomfortable to those who read us. This is key to making this space a safe place where passion and interest in open science brings us together and encourages collaboration.

A mentor is not necessarily to be a person who teaches, trains or coaches, it also supports, encourages their mentees and is open to ask and listen to. It is about helping each other to expand and grow so that everyone learns. Also, an effective mentoring provides opportunities to share talents, skills, experiences and expertise afforded through regular training and on-going coaching and feedback, not only for mentees but also for mentors. The mentors don't have direct responsibility for the mentees\u2019 work performance. They\u00b4 only give advice and they motivate to enhance the mentees\u2019 professional development. Types of mentoring # According to The university of Auckland suggests two types of mentoring relationships: Informal mentoring, when somebody with more experience than others helps spontaneously and without explicitly asking for mentoring. Partnerships are initiated between individuals. Formal mentoring, there is an official ask for or offer of mentoring relationships. Mentors and mentees follow a structured mentoring program, make agreements about its nature and establish goals between them. Skills and experience required to be a mentor # According to Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) , it exists at least ten requirements to be a mentor: Self awareness: it is related to having your own personal goals, career, and knowing your own strengths. Organisational know-how: it means an individual knowledge that mentors have, it provides an advantage over others in the same field, it is about to know how things work. Credibility in Determining Goals and Building Capacity: It is important for mentors to have personal and professional credibility in their area and being a member of relevant organizations Accessibility: successful mentors should be able to commit sufficient time to their mentees. Further, mentors should talk regularly to establish a level of comfort in the relationship around the easy topics, then when a challenge or a concern arises, it is much easier for both to have a useful discussion Communication skills or listening actively, (taking into consideration interests, body language, attention, and giving advice) help to ascertain their mentees motivation and needs. Ability to empower: mentors have the ability to create a working environment where mentees feel secure to contribute in different ways. A desire to help others develop: mentors should understand how mentees learn and acquire experience from mentoring, either formally or informally way. Inventiveness: mentors should be open minds of doing new and different things in mentoring, in order to help mentees gain broader perspectives of their experiences. Empathy: the ability to sense mentees emotions, or what might be thinking or feeling Understanding: mentors can observe their mentees how they learn and provide them constructive feedback. Some other extra skills are: Encouraging and inspiring: mentors have the ability to comment on mentees accomplishments. They believe in the mentees capacity to grow personally and professionally. In addition, they respond to their frustrations and challenges. It is important that mentors share their personal vision or those of other leaders, such as their experiences, mistakes and successes in achieving their goals The Center for Health Leadership & Practice (CHLP) . The mentoring process / stages # The process of mentoring is an activity that has a beginning and ending, MMU lists three stages: Initial;(building the relationship): explain goals of this mentoring. Time to involve (schedule for communication). Discuss backgrounds, experiences, interests and expectations. Establish the rules (format of the meeting). Mentor sessions; planning mentoring sessions (review experiences, when and how long, goals, progress advance). Mentors should tell about themselves, their skills, their organization, experience, and challenges they are facing. Besides, they can exchange information and help their mentees to set and refocus their goals periodically. Finally, they must work towards the goals (long and challenging part of the mentoring process), through discussing, sharing material, trying other learning materials, and development activities. Mentors create opportunities for mentees to gain experience, introduce them to other colleagues. Evaluate the progress of this relationship mentor-mentees (adjustments, results, benefits). Moving on; identify when the relationship mentors-mentees will end such as when objectives conclude, challenges, and progress towards goals. Help mentees to identify next steps, self-reflection. Explore other types of support for their needs. Also, there are other reasons for ending the mentoring relationship, for example, the program is coming to a close or the relationship isn\u2019t working successfully and both parties wish to move on. Setting goals and expectations # According to Harvard University suggests that both mentors and mentees establish their objectives, expectations and actively collaborate to have effective mentoring. Here there some steps to consider: Commitment between mentees and mentors before to start a mentoring relationship because it requires time and effort from both. Self-knowledge, mentees start by determining specific objectives and what is the most relevant and appropriate for them in the mentoring relationship. Once they clarify their goals, now they can consider how this relationship might bring to achieve their goals. Matching: Mentees are ready to consider potential mentors to support them, based on their expectations regarding the qualities and attributes of mentors. Establishing the mentoring relationship. Mentors and mentees should define guidelines and agreements early in mentoring. Planning will keep the mentoring partnership on track and focused on main objectives. Mentors and Mentees should work together to develop action steps for each objective, and how to make it effective. A successful mentoring depends on relationship investment of energy and the commitment to the experience. The end of a mentoring is as much a part of the process as the preceding steps. It is important to understand that it does not mean the end of the relationship. In this process, it can be an excellent opportunity to have a similar discussion about the experience as a whole or celebrate accomplishments. Moreover, former Mentees and Mentors are excellent resources to include on the network. As with any network connection, mentees need to make a point of staying in touch and participate in communities. Mentoring and ethics # The mentors need to continuously examine and reflect on their ethical values and how they may influence decisions in their mentoring practice. In the following, there are some professional characteristics that contribute to having effective mentoring: The mentors and mentees need to be well aware of their institution\u2019s code of conduct for mentoring. At the same time, they should read professional codes of ethics to have a healthy mentoring relationship and accept that before mentoring starts. The mentors need to continuously explore and reflect on their own ethical values and how they may influence decisions in their mentoring practice. The development of normative guidelines, between mentors and mentees are a powerful tool for reflecting together on values and boundaries, and to promote ethical thinking. In most professions, a set of values determine the ethical professional conduct and become a part of the professional identity. The mentors need to take responsibility for the power they hold and never use it abusively over others more vulnerable. It should be an open and clear reporting structure for any misuse of power. The mentees can identify with mentors who have values, attitudes, and experiences that the mentees holds or aspires to have. In addition, The Actuaries w Without Borders describes some personal characteristics in mentoring: Mentors; ask open and supportive questions and provide constructive feedback. Mentors; maintain a friendly tone and be positive. Mentors; encourage developmente opportunities for mentees. Mentors; help mentees solve their own problem, rather than how to do it. Mentors; give positive reinforcement. Mentors; have to be accessible for helping mentees. Mentees; be prepared. Mentees; take responsability for mistakes. Mentees; thank your mentor. Mentors and mentees; Value the mentoring partner as a person Mentors and mentees; Developing mutual trust and respect. Mentors and mentees;Listen actively both to what is being said and how it is being said. Mentoring Best Practices # Mentoring involves the relationship between mentors and mentees. Good mentors are enthusiastic people, enjoying the role they play in helping others achieve their goals (CHLP) . There are some different roles that Mentors may be required to take: Networking; mentors help mentees to find people and resources that go beyond their experience. Counselling; mentors encourage, inspire and challenge mentees to achieve their goals. Also, They act as a confidant, helping mentees to clarify real issues and seeing the general view. Facilitating; mentors share your experiences, advice, emphasizing how your experience could be different from their experiences. Coaching; mentors build their mentees confidence through supportive feedback. Enjoying the process of mentoring; mentors should be spontaneous just to send an encouraging word or piece of new information. Avoid controlling the mentoring relationship. Mentoring Code of Conduct (MCoC) # By accessing or using the OSL mentoring services, and thereby becoming a part of this community, you are agreeing to abide by our Code of Conduct. Participants agree not to engage in any tortious or criminal activity and if you do engage in such activity, you understand that you are fully responsible to the fullest extent of the law and that you will retain your own legal counsel at your own expense, pay and all necessary fines and other costs and agree to hold OSL harmless.

Organisational know-how: it means an individual knowledge that mentors have, it provides an advantage over others in the same field, it is about to know how things work. Credibility in Determining Goals and Building Capacity: It is important for mentors to have personal and professional credibility in their area and being a member of relevant organizations Accessibility: successful mentors should be able to commit sufficient time to their mentees. Further, mentors should talk regularly to establish a level of comfort in the relationship around the easy topics, then when a challenge or a concern arises, it is much easier for both to have a useful discussion Communication skills or listening actively, (taking into consideration interests, body language, attention, and giving advice) help to ascertain their mentees motivation and needs. Ability to empower: mentors have the ability to create a working environment where mentees feel secure to contribute in different ways. A desire to help others develop: mentors should understand how mentees learn and acquire experience from mentoring, either formally or informally way. Inventiveness: mentors should be open minds of doing new and different things in mentoring, in order to help mentees gain broader perspectives of their experiences. Empathy: the ability to sense mentees emotions, or what might be thinking or feeling Understanding: mentors can observe their mentees how they learn and provide them constructive feedback. Some other extra skills are: Encouraging and inspiring: mentors have the ability to comment on mentees accomplishments. They believe in the mentees capacity to grow personally and professionally. In addition, they respond to their frustrations and challenges. It is important that mentors share their personal vision or those of other leaders, such as their experiences, mistakes and successes in achieving their goals The Center for Health Leadership & Practice (CHLP) .","title":"Skills and experience required to be a mentor"},{"location":"about/guidelines/mentoring/#the-mentoring-process-stages","text":"The process of mentoring is an activity that has a beginning and ending, MMU lists three stages: Initial;(building the relationship): explain goals of this mentoring. Time to involve (schedule for communication). Discuss backgrounds, experiences, interests and expectations. Establish the rules (format of the meeting). Mentor sessions; planning mentoring sessions (review experiences, when and how long, goals, progress advance). Mentors should tell about themselves, their skills, their organization, experience, and challenges they are facing. Besides, they can exchange information and help their mentees to set and refocus their goals periodically. Finally, they must work towards the goals (long and challenging part of the mentoring process), through discussing, sharing material, trying other learning materials, and development activities. Mentors create opportunities for mentees to gain experience, introduce them to other colleagues. Evaluate the progress of this relationship mentor-mentees (adjustments, results, benefits). Moving on; identify when the relationship mentors-mentees will end such as when objectives conclude, challenges, and progress towards goals. Help mentees to identify next steps, self-reflection. Explore other types of support for their needs.

Mentors and mentees should define guidelines and agreements early in mentoring. Planning will keep the mentoring partnership on track and focused on main objectives. Mentors and Mentees should work together to develop action steps for each objective, and how to make it effective. A successful mentoring depends on relationship investment of energy and the commitment to the experience. The end of a mentoring is as much a part of the process as the preceding steps. It is important to understand that it does not mean the end of the relationship. In this process, it can be an excellent opportunity to have a similar discussion about the experience as a whole or celebrate accomplishments.

In the following, there are some professional characteristics that contribute to having effective mentoring: The mentors and mentees need to be well aware of their institution\u2019s code of conduct for mentoring. At the same time, they should read professional codes of ethics to have a healthy mentoring relationship and accept that before mentoring starts. The mentors need to continuously explore and reflect on their own ethical values and how they may influence decisions in their mentoring practice. The development of normative guidelines, between mentors and mentees are a powerful tool for reflecting together on values and boundaries, and to promote ethical thinking. In most professions, a set of values determine the ethical professional conduct and become a part of the professional identity. The mentors need to take responsibility for the power they hold and never use it abusively over others more vulnerable. It should be an open and clear reporting structure for any misuse of power. The mentees can identify with mentors who have values, attitudes, and experiences that the mentees holds or aspires to have. In addition, The Actuaries w Without Borders describes some personal characteristics in mentoring: Mentors; ask open and supportive questions and provide constructive feedback. Mentors; maintain a friendly tone and be positive. Mentors; encourage developmente opportunities for mentees. Mentors; help mentees solve their own problem, rather than how to do it.

Esto nos ha permitido implementar una serie de mejoras significativas en SciCookie. A continuaci\u00f3n, presentamos los avances y tareas realizadas. Se han incorporado nuevas opciones de herramientas a la plantilla, incluyendo los c\u00f3digos de conducta (CoC) de Python (adaptado) y de NumFOCUS. Tambi\u00e9n se ha a\u00f1adido soporte para prettier como una opci\u00f3n de linter, proporcionando m\u00e1s flexibilidad a los usuarios. En cuanto a la estructura de la herramienta, se han realizado varias optimizaciones. Se implement\u00f3 una opci\u00f3n condicional para las preguntas de uso de herramientas en el proyecto ( depends_on ) y se corrigi\u00f3 la indentaci\u00f3n en algunos archivos de configuraci\u00f3n para mejorar la legibilidad. Adem\u00e1s, se unificaron estos archivos seg\u00fan las distintas opciones de sistemas de construcci\u00f3n ( build systems ) para evitar la repetici\u00f3n innecesaria de c\u00f3digo y texto. Tambi\u00e9n se cre\u00f3 un ejemplo para la opci\u00f3n de Interfaz de l\u00ednea de comandos (CLI) como base del contenido de ese archivo. En el \u00e1mbito de la documentaci\u00f3n, se ha automatizado el proceso de mover archivos de configuraci\u00f3n a la ra\u00edz del proyecto, manteniendo una estructura ordenada. La selecci\u00f3n del motor de documentaci\u00f3n sphinx se ha dividido en sphinx-rst y sphinx-md(myst) para ofrecer opciones espec\u00edficas. Se ha generado la documentaci\u00f3n de la API para estas opciones, a\u00f1adido quarto como un motor de documentaci\u00f3n adicional, y se han incorporado distintos temas para cada motor de documentaci\u00f3n disponible en la plantilla. Se ha iniciado comunicaci\u00f3n con Leah Wasser, directora ejecutiva de pyOpenSci, quien ha revisado directamente el uso de SciCookie para las necesidades de pyOpenSci como plantilla de proyectos para recomendar a su comunidad.

Its primary objective is to provide a versatile and language-independent structure for ASTs, with the flexibility to be utilized across various programming languages and parsing tools. ASTx doesn't aim to be a lexer or a parser, although it could be used by any programming language or parser written in Python in order to provide a high level representation of the AST. Many kinds of nodes (classes) are currently supported. Below is a list with just some examples: Statements: # Function Function Prototype FunctionReturn ForRangeLoop VarDecl Operators: # BinaryOp UnaryOp Data types: # Boolean Literal Variable The ASTx project is still under development, so new classes may be added to the ones above at any time. Below are installation instructions and an example, so you can have an overview of how you can leverage the ASTx library for your needs. Installation # The first step is to install ASTx. You can do it simply by running the command below in your terminal:\\ $ pip install astx \\ If you need more information on installation, you can get it in the ASTx installation page . After that, you can just open a Jupyter Notebook instance and start writing your first AST. Example: an AST of a series of mathematical operations # Here we will present a quick example of an AST of the expression \\ basic_op = lit_1 + b - a * c / a + (b - a / a) , in which \\ $~~~~$ lit_1 is a defined integer, and \\ $~~~~$ a , b , and c are variables.\\ The first thing to do is, in your Jupyter Notebook instance, import display , which will allow you to have a basic visualization of the AST, and the astx library itself. # import display for AST visualization import astx from astx.viz import graph_to_ascii , traverse_ast_ascii Then we create an instance of the Module class, and this instance will be the first node of the tree, or the root node. After that, we declare the variables and literal that will be part of the basic operation that we will parse into an AST. # Create module module = astx . Module () # Declare variables decl_a = astx . VariableDeclaration ( name = \"a\" , type_ = astx . Int32 , value = astx . LiteralInt32 ( 1 )) decl_b = astx . VariableDeclaration ( name = \"b\" , type_ = astx . Int32 , value = astx . LiteralInt32 ( 2 )) decl_c = astx . VariableDeclaration ( name = \"c\" , type_ = astx . Int32 , value = astx . LiteralInt32 ( 4 )) a = astx . Variable ( name = \"a\" ) b = astx . Variable ( name = \"b\" ) c = astx . Variable ( name = \"c\" ) # Declare literal lit_1 = astx . LiteralInt32 ( 1 ) # State the expression basic_op = lit_1 + b - a * c / a + ( b - a / a ) After the basic expression is stated, we create an instance of the Function class. As mentioned in the API documentation, each instance of the Function class must have a prototype and a body, so we'll create those first. The body is made of a block that is created and the variables, as well as the basic operation, are appended to it afterwards. # Create FunctionPrototype main_proto = astx . FunctionPrototype ( name = \"main\" , args = astx . Arguments (), return_type = astx . Int32 ) # Create FunctionReturn main_block = astx . Block () main_block . append ( decl_a ) main_block . append ( decl_b ) main_block . append ( decl_c ) main_block . append ( astx . FunctionReturn ( basic_op )) # Create Function main_fn = astx . Function ( prototype = main_proto , body = main_block ) # Append function to module module . block . append ( main_fn ) After this, the module is complete. We can get its AST structure as a dictionary, as well as a PNG representation. # Create dictionary representation module . get_struct () OUTPUT {'MODULE[main]': {'content': [{'FUNCTION[main]': {'content': {'args': {'Arguments(0)': {'content': [], 'metadata': {'loc': {line: -1, col: -1}, 'comment': '', 'ref': '', 'kind': }}}, 'body': {'BLOCK': {'content': [{'VariableDeclaration[a, Int32]': {'content': {'Literal[Int32]: 1': {'content': 1, 'metadata': {'loc': {line: -1, col: -1}, 'comment': '', 'ref': 'c4848732a3c542f1b3818bc799dc0b26', 'kind': }}}, 'metadata': {'loc': {line: -1, col: -1}, 'comment': '', 'ref': '', 'kind': }}}, {'VariableDeclaration[b, Int32]': {'content': {'Literal[Int32]: 2': {'content': 2, 'metadata': {'loc': {line: -1, col: -1}, 'comment': '', 'ref': 'b63f0bf700194bb7abbdf99d8cc20336', 'kind': }}}, 'metadata': {'loc': {line: -1, col: -1}, 'comment': '', 'ref': '', 'kind': }}}, {'VariableDeclaration[c, Int32]': {'content': {'Literal[Int32]: 4': {'content': 4, 'metadata': {'loc': {line: -1, col: -1}, 'comment': '', 'ref': '0c0686b5f12a45bd9ff1a20da82702a0', 'kind': }}}, 'metadata': {'loc': {line: -1, col: -1}, 'comment': '', 'ref': '', 'kind': }}}, {'RETURN': {'content': {'BINARY[+]': {'content': {'lhs': {'BINARY[-]': {'content': {'lhs': {'BINARY[+]': {'content': {'lhs': {'Literal[Int32]: 1': {'content': 1, 'metadata': {'loc': {line: -1, col: -1}, 'comment': '', 'ref': '8d5d86d52b98484a8e5947ae4e6556f1', 'kind': }}}, 'rhs': {'Variable[b]': {'content': 'b', 'metadata': {'loc': {line: -1, col: -1}, 'comment': '', 'ref': '', 'kind': }}}}, 'metadata': {'loc': {line: -1, col: -1}, 'comment': '', 'ref': '', 'kind': }}}, 'rhs': {'BINARY[/]': {'content': {'lhs': {'BINARY[*]': {'content': {'lhs': {'Variable[a]': {'content': 'a', 'metadata': {'loc': {line: -1, col: -1}, 'comment': '', 'ref': '', 'kind': }}}, 'rhs': {'Variable[c]': {'content': 'c', 'metadata': {'loc': {line: -1, col: -1}, 'comment': '', 'ref': '', 'kind': }}}}, 'metadata': {'loc': {line: -1, col: -1}, 'comment': '', 'ref': '', 'kind': }}}, 'rhs': {'Variable[a]': {'content': 'a', 'metadata': {'loc': {line: -1, col: -1}, 'comment': '', 'ref': '', 'kind': }}}}, 'metadata': {'loc': {line: -1, col: -1}, 'comment': '', 'ref': '', 'kind': }}}}, 'metadata': {'loc': {line: -1, col: -1}, 'comment': '', 'ref': '', 'kind': }}}, 'rhs': {'BINARY[-]': {'content': {'lhs': {'Variable[b]': {'content': 'b', 'metadata': {'loc': {line: -1, col: -1}, 'comment': '', 'ref': '', 'kind': }}}, 'rhs': {'BINARY[/]': {'content': {'lhs': {'Variable[a]': {'content': 'a', 'metadata': {'loc': {line: -1, col: -1}, 'comment': '', 'ref': '', 'kind': }}}, 'rhs': {'Variable[a]': {'content': 'a', 'metadata': {'loc': {line: -1, col: -1}, 'comment': '', 'ref': '', 'kind': }}}}, 'metadata': {'loc': {line: -1, col: -1}, 'comment': '', 'ref': '', 'kind': }}}}, 'metadata': {'loc': {line: -1, col: -1}, 'comment': '', 'ref': '', 'kind': }}}}, 'metadata': {'loc': {line: -1, col: -1}, 'comment': '', 'ref': '', 'kind': }}}, 'metadata': {'loc': {line: -1, col: -1}, 'comment': '', 'ref': '', 'kind': }}}], 'metadata': {'loc': {line: -1, col: -1}, 'comment': '', 'ref': '', 'kind': }}}}, 'metadata': {'loc': {line: -1, col: -1}, 'comment': '', 'ref': '', 'kind': }}}], 'metadata': {'loc': {line: -1, col: -1}, 'comment': '', 'ref': '', 'kind': }}} # Create ascii representation dot_graph = traverse_ast_ascii ( module . get_struct ( simplified = True )) graph = graph_to_ascii ( dot_graph ) print ( graph ) # Create PNG representation module OUTPUT We can also get the PNG representation of parts of the AST, such as basic_op and the variable a : # Create PNG representation basic_op OUTPUT # Create PNG representation a OUTPUT Custom shapes # It is also possible to use custom shapes for the output using the function viz.visualize .

By offering a guide that covers everything from the basics to best practices in open-source project development, we hope to streamline the onboarding process and foster a more inclusive and productive collaborative environment. This guide will not only be beneficial for those starting their journey in open-source projects but will also serve as the primary reference for all affiliated projects and projects under the OSL Incubator Program. By standardizing practices and promoting a common understanding of the processes involved, we aim to enhance the experience for all contributors and promote more efficient and high-quality development in our open-source projects. Getting Started # In this guide, we'll tackle the common challenges that newcomers encounter in open-source projects. These include navigating Git and establishing your development environment. We'll provide step-by-step instructions on Git fundamentals and setting up your virtual workspace seamlessly. Additionally, we will offer further advice for the contributor to start with a solid initial structure, thus ensuring that their project is well-organized from the outset. From the initial setup to active contribution in the project, this guide aims to provide contributors with the tools and knowledge needed to effectively contribute to open-source programming projects. GIT # What is Git? # Git is a widely used distributed version control system in software development. It allows project collaborators to work collaboratively on the same set of files, recording changes, merging contributions, and maintaining a detailed history of all modifications made to the source code. How to install Git? # To install Git, you can follow these steps: Windows Operating System: You can download the Git installer from the official Git website . Once downloaded, run the installer and follow the installation wizard instructions. macOS Operating System: Git is usually pre-installed on macOS. However, if it's not installed or you want to update it, you can do so through the command line or using package management tools like Homebrew. Linux Operating System: In most Linux distributions, Git is available in the default package repositories. You can install it using the package manager specific to your distribution, such as apt for Ubuntu or yum for CentOS. For more detailed material on Git, we recommend using the Software Carpentry material, which is more focused on people who already have basic knowledge of Git but still face difficulties. You can access the material at the following link: Software Carpentry - Git Novice First Steps to Collaborating on a Project # Understanding Repository Forking # When embarking on a collaborative project, the first step often involves forking a repository. Forking is a fundamental aspect of version control systems like Git, enabling individuals or teams to create their own copy of a project's repository. This copy acts as a sandbox where contributors can freely experiment, make changes, and propose improvements without affecting the original project. Steps to Forking a Repository # Navigate to the Repository: Visit the project's repository on the hosting platform, such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. Locate the Fork Button: Look for the \"Fork\" button on the repository's page. This button is usually located in the top-right corner. Clicking it will initiate the forking process. Choose Destination: When prompted, select where you want to fork the repository. You can fork it to your personal account or to an organization you're a part of. Wait for Forking to Complete: The platform will create a copy of the repository in your account or organization. Depending on the size of the repository and the platform's load, this process may take a few seconds to complete. Clone Your Forked Repository: Once the forking process is finished, clone the forked repository to your local machine using Git. This will create a local copy of the repository that you can work on. Benefits of Forking a Repository # Independence: Forking gives you complete control over your copy of the project. You can modify it as you see fit without impacting the original. Experimentation: Forking provides a safe environment for experimenting with changes. You can try out new features, fix bugs, or test ideas without risking the stability of the main project. Collaboration: Forking facilitates collaboration by enabling contributors to work on different aspects of the project simultaneously. Once you've made improvements or fixes in your fork, you can propose them to the original project through a pull request. What is a Pull Request / Merge Request and why is it important? # A Pull Request (PR) is a proposed change that a collaborator makes to a code repository managed by a version control system such as Git. It's essentially a request for the changes made in one branch of a repository to be incorporated into another branch, usually the main branch. Pull Requests are essential in the collaborative workflow of software development, as they allow teams to review, discuss, and approve changes before they are merged into the codebase. This facilitates collaboration, improves code quality, and helps maintain a clear history of modifications made to the project. Steps for creating a good Pull Request: # Create a feature branch: Before starting to make changes to the code, create a new branch in the repository that clearly describes the purpose of the changes you plan to make. This helps keep the development organized and makes code review easier. Make necessary changes: Once you're on your feature branch, make the changes to the code as planned. Make sure to follow the project's coding conventions and write unit tests if necessary. Update documentation if necessary: If your changes affect existing functionality or introduce new features, it's important to update the corresponding documentation, such as code comments or user documentation. Create the Pull Request: Once you've completed your changes and are ready to request review, create a Pull Request. Provide a clear and concise description of the purpose of your changes, as well as any relevant context to facilitate review by your team members. Request review: After creating the Pull Request, assign relevant reviewers to examine your changes. This may include other developers on the team, technical leads, or anyone with expertise in the area affected by your modifications. Respond to comments and make adjustments if necessary: Once reviewers have provided feedback on your Pull Request, take the time to respond to their questions and make any necessary adjustments to your code. It's important to collaborate constructively during this process to ensure that the proposed changes are of the highest possible quality. By following these steps, you can effectively contribute to a project's development through Pull Requests that are easy to review, approve, and merge, ultimately leading to stronger code and more efficient teamwork. Remotes Repositories # In version control systems like Git, a remote repository is essentially a copy of your local repository stored on a server somewhere else, often online. It acts as a central hub for collaboration and version control. Origin: This remote, typically created by default when cloning the repository, points to your fork on GitHub. Upstream: This remote points to the original (upstream) repository you forked from. It allows you to stay updated with the main project's development. Creating the Upstream Remote git remote add upstream <URL_of_upstream_repository> Using the Upstream Remote: Fetching Updates: Regularly use git fetch upstream to download the latest changes from the upstream repository without merging them into your local branch. Creating Feature Branches: When starting work on a new feature, it's recommended to base your branch on the latest upstream main branch: git checkout upstream/main git checkout -b my-feature-branch This ensures your feature branch incorporates the most recent upstream developments. Understanding Merge Commit vs. Rebase in Git # In Git, managing branches is a fundamental aspect of collaboration and version control. When integrating changes from one branch to another, developers often encounter two primary methods: merge commit and rebase. Both approaches have their advantages and trade-offs, influencing how teams collaborate and maintain a clean project history. Let's delve into each method: Merge Commit # A merge commit, as the name suggests, involves creating a new commit to merge changes from one branch into another. Here's how it typically works: Branch Divergence : Suppose you have a feature branch ( feature ) and a main branch ( main or master ). As work progresses, both branches diverge, accumulating different commits. Merge Process : When it's time to integrate changes from feature into main , you execute a merge command. Git creates a new commit, known as a merge commit, to combine the histories of both branches. Commit History : The merge commit preserves the entire history of changes from both branches, making it clear when and how the integration occurred. Parallel Development : Merge commits allow parallel development, enabling team members to work independently without affecting each other's changes. Rebase # Rebasing is an alternative method for integrating changes, involving rewriting commit history to maintain a linear project history. Here's how it differs from merge commit: Branch Adjustment : Instead of creating a merge commit, rebasing adjusts the commit history of the feature branch ( feature ) to appear as if it originated from the tip of the main branch ( main or master ). Commit Replay : Git replays each commit from the feature branch onto the tip of the main branch, effectively transplanting the changes onto a different base. Linear History : By rewriting commit history, rebasing creates a linear sequence of commits, making the project history cleaner and easier to follow. Conflict Resolution : Rebasing can lead to conflicts if changes from the feature branch conflict with those on the main branch. These conflicts must be resolved manually during the rebase process. Recommendations and Best Practices While both merge commit and rebase have their merits, the choice often depends on the team's workflow and preferences. Here are some considerations: Merge Commit : Suitable for preserving a detailed history of parallel development. Preferred when collaboration involves multiple contributors or when maintaining a clear record of individual contributions is essential. Rebase : - Promotes a cleaner, linear project history. - Recommended for feature branches with short-lived changes or when maintaining a tidy commit history is a priority. It's worth noting that some organizations, such as the Open Source Initiative (OSI), recommend the usage of git rebase to maintain a clean and linear project history. You can configure Git to use rebase by default for pull operations with the command: $ git config --global pull.rebase true OSL recommends the usage of git rebase Mergin a Pull Requests (PRs) # Pull requests (PRs) are essential for collaborative software development, enabling contributors to propose changes to a project's codebase. Once a PR is submitted, it undergoes a review process before being merged into the main codebase. Here are three common methods for merging PRs: 1. Merge Commit: # A merge commit combines changes from different branches in version control systems like Git. It records the integration of these changes, preserving their histories and keeping the project's development organized. Use when you want to keep a detailed history of changes from multiple branches. It preserves individual commit histories, making it suitable for tracking the development of feature branches and bug fixes separately. 2. Squash and Merge: # \"Squash and merge\" condenses multiple commits into one before merging, simplifying the project's commit history. Employ when you have multiple small, related commits that you want to consolidate into a single, more meaningful commit. It's useful for cleaning up the commit history, especially before merging feature branches into the main branch. 3. Rebase and Merge: # \"Rebase and merge\" rewrites commit history to integrate changes from one branch into another, maintaining a cleaner and more linear history. Opt for this method when you want to maintain a clean and linear commit history by incorporating changes from one branch into another. It helps to avoid unnecessary merge commits, keeping the commit history straightforward and easier to follow. Each method offers distinct advantages and considerations, influencing the project's commit history and overall workflow. In their development workflow, Open Science Labs recommend using squash and merge. Pre-commit # Pre-commit is a tool used in software development to automatically run various checks and tests on files before they are committed to a version control system, such as Git. These checks can include code formatting, linting, static analysis, and other quality assurance tasks. The goal is to catch potential issues early in the development process, ensuring that only high-quality code is committed to the repository. Here's how to install and use pre-commit: Installation: You can install pre-commit using pip, the Python package manager. Open your terminal or command prompt and run: $ pip install pre-commit Configuration: Once pre-commit is installed, you need to set up a configuration file named .pre-commit-config.yaml in the root directory of your project. This file specifies the hooks (checks) that pre-commit should run. Here's a basic example of a .pre-commit-config.yaml file: repos : - repo : https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks rev : v3.3.0 hooks : - id : trailing-whitespace - id : end-of-file-fixer - id : check-yaml Installation of Git Hooks: After configuring .pre-commit-config.yaml , you need to install pre-commit hooks into your Git repository. Navigate to your project directory in the terminal and run: $ pre-commit install Running Pre-commit: Once the pre-commit hooks are installed, you can run them manually using the following command: $ pre-commit run --all-files This command tells pre-commit to run all configured hooks on all files in the repository. It will check for issues according to the configuration specified in .pre-commit-config.yaml and provide feedback on any problems found. The Git hooks are triggered each time the user initiates a git commit command. By default, they operate on the files that have been modified, but their behavior can be adjusted to encompass all files if configured accordingly in the .pre-commit-config.yaml file. Navigating Git Workflows: A Dive into GitHub Flow and GitFlow # In the ever-evolving world of software development, efficient collaboration and streamlined workflows are paramount. Git, the popular version control system, offers a plethora of options for managing code changes, each tailored to different team structures and project requirements. Two widely used workflows, GitHub Flow and GitFlow, stand out for their simplicity and effectiveness. Let's explore these options in detail. GitHub Flow: # GitHub Flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow specifically designed for teams using GitHub for version control. It emphasizes simplicity and continuous delivery, making it an ideal choice for projects with frequent releases and rapid iteration cycles. Here's a breakdown of its key features: Branching Model: - Main Branch: GitHub Flow revolves around a single main branch (often named \"main\" or \"master\"), representing the development branch that leads to production-ready code. - Feature Branches: Developers create feature branches off the main branch for each new feature or bug fix. Workflow: Create a Branch: Developers create a new branch for each feature or bug fix. Make Changes: Developers create a new branch, with the latest changes from upstream/main (or origin/main, if you are not working on a fork) for each feature or bug fix. Open Pull Request: Once changes are complete, a pull request (PR) is opened to merge the feature branch into the main branch. Review and Merge: Team members review the code changes, provide feedback, and merge the PR into the main branch once approved. Continuous Deployment : Continuous Integration: GitHub Flow encourages the use of continuous integration tools to automatically test changes before merging. Continuous Deployment: Merged changes are automatically deployed to production, ensuring a fast and reliable release cycle. GitHub Flow's simplicity and flexibility make it a popular choice for teams of all sizes, particularly those embracing agile development practices. GitFlow: # GitFlow, developed by Vincent Driessen, provides a more organized approach to branching and release management. It excels in larger projects with longer release cycles and strict versioning requirements. Here's how GitFlow differs from GitHub Flow: Branching Model : Main Branches: GitFlow defines two main branches \u2013 \"master\" for stable releases and \"develop\" for ongoing development. Feature Branches: Developers create feature branches off the \"develop\" branch for each new feature. Workflow : Feature Development: Developers work on feature branches, merging them into the \"develop\" branch once complete. Release Branches: When it's time for a new release, a release branch is created from the \"develop\" branch for final testing and bug fixing. Hotfix Branches: If critical issues arise in production, hotfix branches are created from the \"master\" branch to address them directly. Versioning : GitFlow employs a strict versioning scheme, with each release assigned a unique version number based on semantic versioning principles. Which Workflow to Choose? # Choosing between GitHub Flow and GitFlow depends on your team's specific needs and project requirements: GitHub Flow : Ideal for teams focused on continuous delivery, rapid iteration, and simplicity. This is most used in a bunch of projects. GitFlow : Suited for larger projects with longer release cycles, strict versioning, and a more structured approach to development. While both workflows have their merits, it's essential to assess your team's workflow preferences, project size, and release cycle frequency before making a decision.

What is a virtual enviroment and why is it important? # A virtual environment is a self-contained directory that isolates the dependencies for a specific project, regardless of the programming language. It can house an interpreter (like Python) along with its associated libraries, but it can also manage dependencies for other languages and tools. This isolation ensures that the project's requirements don't conflict with those of other projects on the same system. When you create a virtual environment for each of your projects, it essentially creates a sandboxed environment where you can install packages and dependencies without affecting the global Python installation on your system. This isolation is crucial because different projects often require different versions of libraries or dependencies, and conflicts can arise if they share the same environment. Creating virtual environments is crucial for several reasons: Isolation: Virtual environments allow you to isolate project dependencies, preventing conflicts between different projects that may require different versions of the same packages. This ensures that your projects remain stable and reproducible. Dependency Management: By creating separate environments for each project, you can manage dependencies more effectively. You can install specific versions of packages for each project without affecting other projects or the system-wide installation. Experimentation: Virtual environments provide a safe space for experimentation. You can try out new packages or versions without worrying about breaking existing projects or the system environment. Reproducibility: Utilizing virtual environments not only streamlines collaboration but also enhances reproducibility in project workflows. By sharing environment configuration files such as environment.yml, collaborators ensure uniformity in dependencies and versions across all team members. This practice mitigates compatibility issues and fosters consistency, enabling seamless replication of results and facilitating smoother collaboration.

This facilitates collaboration, improves code quality, and helps maintain a clear history of modifications made to the project.","title":"What is a Pull Request / Merge Request and why is it important?"},{"location":"blog/first-time-contributors/#steps-for-creating-a-good-pull-request","text":"Create a feature branch: Before starting to make changes to the code, create a new branch in the repository that clearly describes the purpose of the changes you plan to make. This helps keep the development organized and makes code review easier. Make necessary changes: Once you're on your feature branch, make the changes to the code as planned. Make sure to follow the project's coding conventions and write unit tests if necessary. Update documentation if necessary: If your changes affect existing functionality or introduce new features, it's important to update the corresponding documentation, such as code comments or user documentation. Create the Pull Request: Once you've completed your changes and are ready to request review, create a Pull Request. Provide a clear and concise description of the purpose of your changes, as well as any relevant context to facilitate review by your team members. Request review: After creating the Pull Request, assign relevant reviewers to examine your changes. This may include other developers on the team, technical leads, or anyone with expertise in the area affected by your modifications. Respond to comments and make adjustments if necessary: Once reviewers have provided feedback on your Pull Request, take the time to respond to their questions and make any necessary adjustments to your code. It's important to collaborate constructively during this process to ensure that the proposed changes are of the highest possible quality.

When integrating changes from one branch to another, developers often encounter two primary methods: merge commit and rebase. Both approaches have their advantages and trade-offs, influencing how teams collaborate and maintain a clean project history. Let's delve into each method:","title":"Understanding Merge Commit vs. Rebase in Git"},{"location":"blog/first-time-contributors/#merge-commit","text":"A merge commit, as the name suggests, involves creating a new commit to merge changes from one branch into another. Here's how it typically works: Branch Divergence : Suppose you have a feature branch ( feature ) and a main branch ( main or master ). As work progresses, both branches diverge, accumulating different commits. Merge Process : When it's time to integrate changes from feature into main , you execute a merge command. Git creates a new commit, known as a merge commit, to combine the histories of both branches. Commit History : The merge commit preserves the entire history of changes from both branches, making it clear when and how the integration occurred. Parallel Development : Merge commits allow parallel development, enabling team members to work independently without affecting each other's changes.","title":"Merge Commit"},{"location":"blog/first-time-contributors/#rebase","text":"Rebasing is an alternative method for integrating changes, involving rewriting commit history to maintain a linear project history. Here's how it differs from merge commit: Branch Adjustment : Instead of creating a merge commit, rebasing adjusts the commit history of the feature branch ( feature ) to appear as if it originated from the tip of the main branch ( main or master ). Commit Replay : Git replays each commit from the feature branch onto the tip of the main branch, effectively transplanting the changes onto a different base. Linear History : By rewriting commit history, rebasing creates a linear sequence of commits, making the project history cleaner and easier to follow. Conflict Resolution : Rebasing can lead to conflicts if changes from the feature branch conflict with those on the main branch. These conflicts must be resolved manually during the rebase process. Recommendations and Best Practices While both merge commit and rebase have their merits, the choice often depends on the team's workflow and preferences. Here are some considerations: Merge Commit : Suitable for preserving a detailed history of parallel development. Preferred when collaboration involves multiple contributors or when maintaining a clear record of individual contributions is essential. Rebase : - Promotes a cleaner, linear project history. - Recommended for feature branches with short-lived changes or when maintaining a tidy commit history is a priority. It's worth noting that some organizations, such as the Open Source Initiative (OSI), recommend the usage of git rebase to maintain a clean and linear project history.

Introduction # During the Open Science Labs Q1 2024 internship, I worked on the Fqlearn project. Fqlearn is an open source python library, currently in development, which aims to facilitate the teaching of mass transfer and thermodynamics. My main task involved developing methods to use a three phase diagram to solve thermodynamics problems graphically. For this purpose, I wrote code for the ThreeComponent.py class, as well as corresponding tests for the class. Ternary phase diagram # A ternary plot, ternary graph, triangle plot, simplex plot, or Gibbs triangle is a barycentric plot on three variables which sum to a constant. It graphically depicts the ratios of the three variables as positions in an equilateral triangle. It is used in physical chemistry, petrology, mineralogy, metallurgy, and other physical sciences to show the compositions of systems composed of three species. Ternary plots are tools for analyzing compositional data in the three-dimensional case [ 1 ]. In a ternary plot, the values of the three variables a, b, and c must sum to some constant, K. Usually, this constant is represented as 1.0 or 100%. Because a + b + c = K for all substances being graphed, any one variable is not independent of the others, so only two variables must be known to find a sample's point on the graph: for instance, c must be equal to K \u2212 a \u2212 b. Because the three numerical values cannot vary independently\u2014there are only two degrees of freedom\u2014it is possible to graph the combinations of all three variables in only two dimensions. The advantage of using a ternary plot for depicting chemical compositions is that three variables can be conveniently plotted in a two-dimensional graph. Ternary plots can also be used to create phase diagrams by outlining the composition regions on the plot where different phases exist [ 1 ]. Methods # To begin with, we import the libraries required for plotting ternary phase diagrams. We used python-ternary , a plotting library that uses matplotlib to make ternary plots. Using this library, many features could be added to the fqlearn library for various purposes, as described in this article. import matplotlib as plt import numpy as np import ternary from scipy.interpolate import CubicSpline Then we define our class, ThreeComponent , in which we create some functions, a few of which will be explained in this article. To see how these functions work, we create some variables, which are lists containing an unordered list of tuples, each containing 3 values, representing the x, y and z values in the form [(x,y,z)] . right_eq_line = [( 0.02 , 0.02 , 0.96 ), ( 0.025 , 0.06 , 0.915 ), ( 0.03 , 0.1 , 0.87 ), ( 0.035 , 0.16 , 0.805 ), ( 0.04 , 0.2 , 0.76 ), ( 0.045 , 0.25 , 0.705 ), ( 0.05 , 0.3 , 0.65 ), ( 0.07 , 0.36 , 0.57 ), ( 0.09 , 0.4 , 0.51 ), ( 0.14 , 0.48 , 0.38 ), ( 0.33 , 0.49 , 0.18 )] left_eq_line = [( 0.97 , 0.01 , 0.02 ), ( 0.95 , 0.03 , 0.02 ), ( 0.91 , 0.06 , 0.03 ), ( 0.88 , 0.09 , 0.03 ), ( 0.83 , 0.13 , 0.04 ), ( 0.79 , 0.17 , 0.04 ), ( 0.745 , 0.2 , 0.055 ), ( 0.68 , 0.26 , 0.06 ), ( 0.62 , 0.3 , 0.08 ), ( 0.49 , 0.4 , 0.11 ), ( 0.33 , 0.49 , 0.18 )] points = left_eq_line + right_eq_line We also set the scale of our plot to 100 in the __init__ function . This is the value that each tuple must sum up to. self . scale = 100 To start using the Three Component class, we can use the following code: from fqlearn import ThreeComponent model = ThreeComponent () We can then call the functions as needed. We define a function sort_points that sorts the values it receives as an argument. The points are added using the add_point function, which ensures that the argument is not an empty list, removes duplicate tuples, and multiplies each point in the tuple by the scale. def add_point ( self , points ): # Check if points is an empty list if not points : raise ValueError ( \"The 'points' list cannot be empty. Please provide valid points.\" ) # Remove duplicate points points_to_plot = list ( set ( points )) # Multiply each point by the scale points_to_plot = [ ( x * self . scale , y * self . scale , z * self . scale ) for x , y , z in points_to_plot ] # Add the points to the plot self . tax . scatter ( points_to_plot , linewidth = 1.0 , marker = \"o\" , color = \"red\" ) return points_to_plot The sort_points function sorts the tuples using the x value in each tuple, then adds them to a new list. This allows us to have the tuples sorted in ascending order along the x-axis. The function also ensures that all points in the tuple(s) in the sorted list add up to the scale. def sort_points ( self , points ): points_to_plot = self . add_point ( points ) # Sort the points in ascending order xyz = [( x , y , z ) for x , y , z in points_to_plot ] sorted_points = sorted ( xyz , key = lambda m : m [ 0 ]) # New list to store sorted points new_sorted_points = [] # Check if the points are in a list of lists or a single list if isinstance ( sorted_points [ 0 ], ( int , float ) ): # Check if the first element of points is a number assert sorted_points [ 0 ] + sorted_points [ 1 ] + sorted_points [ 2 ] == self . scale new_sorted_points . append ( sorted_points ) else : # If the points are in a list of lists for sorted_point in sorted_points : assert sorted_point [ 0 ] + sorted_point [ 1 ] + sorted_point [ 2 ] == self . scale new_sorted_points . append ( sorted_point ) # Add the points to the plot self . tax . scatter ( new_sorted_points , linewidth = 1.0 , marker = \"o\" , color = \"red\" ) return new_sorted_points If we print the returned values, we get the following output, where each tuple is arranged in ascending order according to the x values: [(2.0, 2.0, 96.0), (2.5, 6.0, 91.5), (3.0, 10.0, 87.0), (3.5000000000000004, 16.0, 80.5), (4.0, 20.0, 76.0), (4.5, 25.0, 70.5), (5.0, 30.0, 65.0), (7.000000000000001, 36.0, 56.99999999999999), (9.0, 40.0, 51.0), (14.000000000000002, 48.0, 38.0), (33.0, 49.0, 18.0), (49.0, 40.0, 11.0), (62.0, 30.0, 8.0), (68.0, 26.0, 6.0), (74.5, 20.0, 5.5), (79.0, 17.0, 4.0), (83.0, 13.0, 4.0), (88.0, 9.0, 3.0), (91.0, 6.0, 3.0), (95.0, 3.0, 2.0), (97.0, 1.0, 2.0)] We can then call the plot function, to plot the ternary phase diagram in order to visualize the plotted points. def plot ( self ): self . tax . clear_matplotlib_ticks () self . tax . get_axes () . axis ( \"off\" ) self . tax . legend () ternary . plt . show () We obtain the ternary plot shown below: We define the composition_line function which plots equilibrium lines joining the tuples corresponding to the two compositions in each index in the list of tuples. This function first multiplies each point in each tuple by the scale, then sorts the list of the left composition in ascending order, and the list of the right composition in descending order. For each tuple, the x, y and z values are extracted, then joined using equilibrium lines. def composition_line ( self , left_eq_line , right_eq_line ): # Multiply each point by the scale new_left_eq_line = [ ( x * self . scale , y * self . scale , z * self . scale ) for x , y , z in left_eq_line ] new_right_eq_line = [ ( x * self . scale , y * self . scale , z * self . scale ) for x , y , z in right_eq_line ] # Sort the left points in ascending order xyz = [( x , y , z ) for x , y , z in new_left_eq_line ] sorted_left_eq_line = sorted ( xyz , key = lambda m : m [ 0 ]) # Sort the right points in descending order xyz = [( x , y , z ) for x , y , z in new_right_eq_line ] sorted_right_eq_line = sorted ( xyz , key = lambda m : m [ 0 ], reverse = True ) for i in range ( len ( left_eq_line )): # Ensure all points add up to the scale pointA = sorted_left_eq_line [ i ] assert sum ( pointA ) == self . scale pointB = sorted_right_eq_line [ i ] assert sum ( pointB ) == self . scale # Extract x and y coordinates of each point xA , yA , zA = pointA xB , yB , zB = pointB # Add the two points to the plot self . tax . scatter ([( xA , yA , zA ), ( xB , yB , zB )], marker = \"s\" , color = \"red\" ) # Plot a line connecting the two points self . tax . plot ( [( xA , yA , zA ), ( xB , yB , zB )], linewidth = 1.0 , color = \"blue\" , ) We obtain the following ternary plot: We can calculate the slope of the equilibrium lines plotted above using the function eq_slope . We loop through each tuple of each composition in each index, extract the x and y values, and find the slope, by dividing the change in y by the change in x for each index. The function returns the average slope. def eq_slope ( self , right_eq_line , left_eq_line ): # Multiply each point by the scale right_eq_line = [ ( x * self . scale , y * self . scale , z * self . scale ) for x , y , z in right_eq_line ] left_eq_line = [ ( x * self . scale , y * self . scale , z * self . scale ) for x , y , z in left_eq_line ] # Sort the right points in ascending order xyz = [( x , y , z ) for x , y , z in right_eq_line ] right_eq = sorted ( xyz , key = lambda m : m [ 0 ]) # Sort the left points in descending order xyz = [( x , y , z ) for x , y , z in left_eq_line ] left_eq = sorted ( xyz , key = lambda m : m [ 0 ], reverse = True ) slopes = [] for i in range ( len ( right_eq_line )): pointA = right_eq [ i ] assert sum ( pointA ) == self . scale pointB = left_eq [ i ] assert sum ( pointB ) == self . scale # Extract x and y coordinates of each point xA , yA , _ = pointA xB , yB , _ = pointB # Calculate the slope of the line joining the points if xA - xB != 0 : # Check for vertical line slope = ( yA - yB ) / ( xA - xB ) slopes . append ( slope ) else : # For vertical lines, return None for slope slopes . append ( 0 ) print ( \"Slope = \" , slopes ) # Calculate average of the slopes avg_slope = sum ( slopes ) / len ( slopes ) print ( \"Average slope = \" , avg_slope ) return avg_slope We obtain the following output: Slope = [-0.010526315789473684, -0.032432432432432434, -0.045454545454545456, -0.08284023668639054, -0.08860759493670886, -0.10738255033557047, -0.14388489208633093, -0.16393442622950818, -0.18867924528301888, -0.22857142857142856, 0] Average slope = -0.09930124252776436 We can also plot a ternary phase diagram with an equilibrium line joining all the plotted points, like in a graph, by calling the add_eq_line function. def add_eq_line ( self , right_eq_line , left_eq_line ): # Add the points self . right_eq_line = self . sort_points ( right_eq_line ) self . left_eq_line = self . sort_points ( left_eq_line ) eq_line = self . right_eq_line + self . left_eq_line # Remove duplicate points eq_line_plot = list ( set ( eq_line )) # Sort the points in ascending order xyz = [( x , y , z ) for x , y , z in eq_line_plot ] sorted_eq = sorted ( xyz , key = lambda m : m [ 0 ]) self . tax . plot ( sorted_eq , linewidth = 1.0 , color = \"blue\" , label = \"Equilibrium line\" ) We get the ternary plot below: However, the equilibrium line plotted above is not smooth. To generate a smooth line, we use the interpolate_points function. We first sort the points using the sort_points function. Then we extract the x and y values from the sorted points, ignoring the z values which will not be used. Variable x becomes a list of all x values and variable y becomes a list of all y values. After that, we perform cubic spline interpolation on the x and y values using the CubicSpline function, imported from the scipy.interpolate module of SciPy's library [ 2 ]. bc_type=\"natural\" specifies the natural boundary conditions, meaning the second derivative of the spline at the boundaries will be set to zero. x_cubic is set to a linearly spaced array of values ranging from 0 to 100 with 100 number of points, which is the value of self.scale , and y_cubic contains the corresponding y values interpolated using the cubic spline function f . Then we filter out any points outside the specified range of 0 to 100 for both x_cubic and y_cubic , and use the np.column_stack function to combine x_cubic and y_cubic into a single 2D array, which is returned by the function as interpolated_points . def interpolate_points ( self , points ): sorted_points = self . sort_points ( points ) # Cubic spline interpolation x = [ x for x , y , _ in sorted_points ] y = [ y for x , y , _ in sorted_points ] f = CubicSpline ( x , y , bc_type = \"natural\" ) x_cubic = np . linspace ( 0 , self . scale , self . scale ) y_cubic = f ( x_cubic ) # Remove negative points interpolated_points = [ [ i , j ] for i , j in np . column_stack (( x_cubic , y_cubic )) if 0 <= i <= self . scale and 0 <= j <= self . scale ] return interpolated_points Printing the output of the function, we obtain the output below, showing the interpolated points: [[2.0202020202020203, 2.1691472640742586], [3.0303030303030303, 10.329514857514697], [4.040404040404041, 20.340775738329878], [5.050505050505051, 30.41604117022922], [6.0606060606060606, 34.9725244736696], [7.070707070707071, 36.0788150823154], [8.080808080808081, 37.866519430111914], [9.090909090909092, 40.207639450509895], [10.101010101010102, 42.33305618527275], [11.111111111111112, 44.15164951408806], [12.121212121212121, 45.70152886497335], [13.131313131313131, 47.02080366594621], [14.141414141414142, 48.147569717383064], [15.151515151515152, 49.11261947676193], [16.161616161616163, 49.927423194367556], [17.171717171717173, 50.600292249170636], [18.181818181818183, 51.13953802014185], [19.191919191919194, 51.55347188625187], [20.202020202020204, 51.850405226471395], [21.212121212121215, 52.038649419771076], [22.222222222222225, 52.12651584512162], [23.232323232323235, 52.122315881493684], [24.242424242424242, 52.03436090785797], [25.252525252525253, 51.87096230318516], [26.262626262626263, 51.640431446445916], [27.272727272727273, 51.35107971661092], [28.282828282828284, 51.011218492650855], [29.292929292929294, 50.62915915353641], [30.303030303030305, 50.213213078238255], [31.313131313131315, 49.771691645727074], [32.323232323232325, 49.31290623497355], [33.333333333333336, 48.84510804535748], [34.343434343434346, 48.37284930204433], [35.35353535353536, 47.89489752249601], [36.36363636363637, 47.409516570717145], [37.37373737373738, 46.91497031071236], [38.38383838383839, 46.40952260648627], [39.3939393939394, 45.891437322043494], [40.40404040404041, 45.358978321388655], [41.41414141414142, 44.81040946852637], [42.42424242424243, 44.24399462746127], [43.43434343434344, 43.65799766219796], [44.44444444444445, 43.050682436741056], [45.45454545454546, 42.4203128150952], [46.46464646464647, 41.765152661265006], [47.47474747474748, 41.083465839255076], [48.484848484848484, 40.373516213070054], [49.494949494949495, 39.63371670174959], [50.505050505050505, 38.86607499990182], [51.515151515151516, 38.076288591118626], [52.525252525252526, 37.270223020764256], [53.535353535353536, 36.45374383420295], [54.54545454545455, 35.63271657679892], [55.55555555555556, 34.81300679391643], [56.56565656565657, 34.000480030919704], [57.57575757575758, 33.201001833172974], [58.58585858585859, 32.42043774604049], [59.5959595959596, 31.664653314886465], [60.60606060606061, 30.93951408507516], [61.61616161616162, 30.250885601970786], [62.62626262626263, 29.60336029919871], [63.63636363636364, 28.983912044764498], [64.64646464646465, 28.366648419185424], [65.65656565656566, 27.72538388514391], [66.66666666666667, 27.0339329053224], [67.67676767676768, 26.26610994240331], [68.68686868686869, 25.39917799115036], [69.6969696969697, 24.44860975371087], [70.70707070707071, 23.453665293050822], [71.71717171717172, 22.45396405508463], [72.72727272727273, 21.489125485726685], [73.73737373737374, 20.59876903089141], [74.74747474747475, 19.822230508859366], [75.75757575757576, 19.162761793258028], [76.76767676767678, 18.552564414178864], [77.77777777777779, 17.915539652280298], [78.7878787878788, 17.175588788220747], [79.7979797979798, 16.27016258697005], [80.80808080808082, 15.240129979240486], [81.81818181818183, 14.174027140890017], [82.82828282828284, 13.160644754568583], [83.83838383838385, 12.27416074496895], [84.84848484848486, 11.4905826393484], [85.85858585858587, 10.745488901010873], [86.86868686868688, 9.974332435176901], [87.87878787878789, 9.112566147067007], [88.8888888888889, 8.11684009659671], [89.89898989898991, 7.065697936762742], [90.90909090909092, 6.081168542871885], [91.91919191919193, 5.257512388433542], [92.92929292929294, 4.543021889369125], [93.93939393939395, 3.8382841183777483], [94.94949494949496, 3.043859233178794], [95.95959595959597, 2.0885249765853326], [96.96969696969697, 1.0322241687602192]] Next, we define a function, div_half , to divide an equilibrium line in half, and thus dividing the interpolated points in the left side from those in the right side.

The first value of dydx is given by dydx[i] = (y[i+1] - y[i])/(x[i+1] - x[i]) along the given axis and higher differences are calculated by using np.diff recursively. def derivative ( self , points ): points_to_derive = self . interpolate_points ( points ) # Extract x and y values x = [ x for x , _ in points_to_derive ] y = [ y for _ , y in points_to_derive ] # Calculate derivative dydx = np . diff ([ y ]) / np . diff ([ x ]) return dydx We can print out dydx to see the output: [[ 8.07876392e+00 9.91114827e+00 9.97451278e+00 4.51091847e+00 1.09522770e+00 1.76982730e+00 2.31770882e+00 2.10416257e+00 1.80040740e+00 1.53438056e+00 1.30608205e+00 1.11549839e+00 9.55399262e-01 8.06655680e-01 6.66140364e-01 5.33853313e-01 4.09794527e-01 2.93964007e-01 1.86361751e-01 8.69877611e-02 -4.15796399e-03 -8.70754239e-02 -1.61764619e-01 -2.28225548e-01 -2.86458213e-01 -3.36462612e-01 -3.78238746e-01 -4.11786615e-01 -4.37106218e-01 -4.54197557e-01 -4.63120208e-01 -4.67536156e-01 -4.73172262e-01 -4.80527142e-01 -4.89600797e-01 -5.00393227e-01 -5.12904432e-01 -5.27134411e-01 -5.43083164e-01 -5.60750693e-01 -5.80136996e-01 -6.01242073e-01 -6.24065925e-01 -6.48608552e-01 -6.74869954e-01 -7.02850130e-01 -7.32401516e-01 -7.59965285e-01 -7.81888545e-01 -7.98004915e-01 -8.08314395e-01 -8.12816985e-01 -8.11512685e-01 -8.04401495e-01 -7.91483416e-01 -7.72758446e-01 -7.48226587e-01 -7.17887838e-01 -6.81742198e-01 -6.41050050e-01 -6.13253772e-01 -6.11090989e-01 -6.34851889e-01 -6.84536470e-01 -7.60144733e-01 -8.58262632e-01 -9.41062555e-01 -9.84995016e-01 -9.89704226e-01 -9.55190184e-01 -8.81452890e-01 -7.68773137e-01 -6.52874028e-01 -6.04095405e-01 -6.30654514e-01 -7.32551355e-01 -8.96371939e-01 -1.01973228e+00 -1.05544181e+00 -1.00324856e+00 -8.77619170e-01 -7.75742325e-01 -7.37642801e-01 -7.63444901e-01 -8.53148625e-01 -9.85768790e-01 -1.04063074e+00 -9.74684100e-01 -8.15419593e-01 -7.07345594e-01 -6.97690393e-01 -7.86480636e-01 -9.45780914e-01 -1.04573780e+00]] Then we use the min_diff function to find the index of the point that is at the centre of the equilibrium line, which divides it into 2 halves. Starting with an index value of zero and a minimum difference given by the difference between the absolute of the first dydx value and the average slope, we iterate over the indices of dydx to find the index of the dydx value which is closest to the average slope avg_slope . def min_diff ( self , right_eq_line , left_eq_line ): self . points = right_eq_line + left_eq_line dydx = self . derivative ( self . points ) avg_slope = self . eq_slope ( right_eq_line , left_eq_line ) min_index = 0 # Initialize min_diff_value with the first element difference min_diff_value = abs ( dydx [ 0 ][ 0 ] - avg_slope ) # Iterate over indices of dydx for index in range ( 0 , dydx . size ): diff = abs ( dydx [ 0 ][ index ] - avg_slope ) if diff < min_diff_value : min_diff_value = diff min_index = index return min_index We then define the div_half function that divides the equilibrium line precisely in half. We use the interpolated points from the interpolate_points function, which ensures that the point of division is very precise. Then we use the min_diff function to obtain the index of the point dividing the equilibrium line in half. Using this index, we can halve the interpolated points, and plot two equilibrium lines on the right and left side of the ternary plot using these points. def div_half ( self , right_eq_line , left_eq_line ): # Add the points self . points = right_eq_line + left_eq_line interpolated_points = self . interpolate_points ( self . points ) # Use index to separate right and left side index = self . min_diff ( right_eq_line , left_eq_line ) self . interpolated_right_side = interpolated_points [ index :] self . interpolated_left_side = interpolated_points [: index + 1 ] # Plot the curve self . tax . plot ( self . interpolated_right_side , linewidth = 1.0 , color = \"blue\" , label = \"Right interpolated curve\" , ) self . tax . plot ( self . interpolated_left_side , linewidth = 1.0 , color = \"orange\" , label = \"Left interpolated curve\" , ) We obtain the following ternary plot: Acknowledgements # I would like to thank the Open Science Labs and The Graph Network for giving me the opportunity to learn and gain experience in open source through this internship.

It graphically depicts the ratios of the three variables as positions in an equilateral triangle. It is used in physical chemistry, petrology, mineralogy, metallurgy, and other physical sciences to show the compositions of systems composed of three species. Ternary plots are tools for analyzing compositional data in the three-dimensional case [ 1 ]. In a ternary plot, the values of the three variables a, b, and c must sum to some constant, K. Usually, this constant is represented as 1.0 or 100%. Because a + b + c = K for all substances being graphed, any one variable is not independent of the others, so only two variables must be known to find a sample's point on the graph: for instance, c must be equal to K \u2212 a \u2212 b. Because the three numerical values cannot vary independently\u2014there are only two degrees of freedom\u2014it is possible to graph the combinations of all three variables in only two dimensions. The advantage of using a ternary plot for depicting chemical compositions is that three variables can be conveniently plotted in a two-dimensional graph. Ternary plots can also be used to create phase diagrams by outlining the composition regions on the plot where different phases exist [ 1 ].","title":"Ternary phase diagram"},{"location":"blog/fqlearn-ternary-plot/#methods","text":"To begin with, we import the libraries required for plotting ternary phase diagrams. We used python-ternary , a plotting library that uses matplotlib to make ternary plots. Using this library, many features could be added to the fqlearn library for various purposes, as described in this article. import matplotlib as plt import numpy as np import ternary from scipy.interpolate import CubicSpline Then we define our class, ThreeComponent , in which we create some functions, a few of which will be explained in this article. To see how these functions work, we create some variables, which are lists containing an unordered list of tuples, each containing 3 values, representing the x, y and z values in the form [(x,y,z)] . right_eq_line = [( 0.02 , 0.02 , 0.96 ), ( 0.025 , 0.06 , 0.915 ), ( 0.03 , 0.1 , 0.87 ), ( 0.035 , 0.16 , 0.805 ), ( 0.04 , 0.2 , 0.76 ), ( 0.045 , 0.25 , 0.705 ), ( 0.05 , 0.3 , 0.65 ), ( 0.07 , 0.36 , 0.57 ), ( 0.09 , 0.4 , 0.51 ), ( 0.14 , 0.48 , 0.38 ), ( 0.33 , 0.49 , 0.18 )] left_eq_line = [( 0.97 , 0.01 , 0.02 ), ( 0.95 , 0.03 , 0.02 ), ( 0.91 , 0.06 , 0.03 ), ( 0.88 , 0.09 , 0.03 ), ( 0.83 , 0.13 , 0.04 ), ( 0.79 , 0.17 , 0.04 ), ( 0.745 , 0.2 , 0.055 ), ( 0.68 , 0.26 , 0.06 ), ( 0.62 , 0.3 , 0.08 ), ( 0.49 , 0.4 , 0.11 ), ( 0.33 , 0.49 , 0.18 )] points = left_eq_line + right_eq_line We also set the scale of our plot to 100 in the __init__ function . This is the value that each tuple must sum up to. self . scale = 100 To start using the Three Component class, we can use the following code: from fqlearn import ThreeComponent model = ThreeComponent () We can then call the functions as needed. We define a function sort_points that sorts the values it receives as an argument. The points are added using the add_point function, which ensures that the argument is not an empty list, removes duplicate tuples, and multiplies each point in the tuple by the scale. def add_point ( self , points ): # Check if points is an empty list if not points : raise ValueError ( \"The 'points' list cannot be empty. Please provide valid points.\" ) # Remove duplicate points points_to_plot = list ( set ( points )) # Multiply each point by the scale points_to_plot = [ ( x * self . scale , y * self . scale , z * self . scale ) for x , y , z in points_to_plot ] # Add the points to the plot self . tax . scatter ( points_to_plot , linewidth = 1.0 , marker = \"o\" , color = \"red\" ) return points_to_plot The sort_points function sorts the tuples using the x value in each tuple, then adds them to a new list. This allows us to have the tuples sorted in ascending order along the x-axis. The function also ensures that all points in the tuple(s) in the sorted list add up to the scale. def sort_points ( self , points ): points_to_plot = self . add_point ( points ) # Sort the points in ascending order xyz = [( x , y , z ) for x , y , z in points_to_plot ] sorted_points = sorted ( xyz , key = lambda m : m [ 0 ]) # New list to store sorted points new_sorted_points = [] # Check if the points are in a list of lists or a single list if isinstance ( sorted_points [ 0 ], ( int , float ) ): # Check if the first element of points is a number assert sorted_points [ 0 ] + sorted_points [ 1 ] + sorted_points [ 2 ] == self . scale new_sorted_points . append ( sorted_points ) else : # If the points are in a list of lists for sorted_point in sorted_points : assert sorted_point [ 0 ] + sorted_point [ 1 ] + sorted_point [ 2 ] == self . scale new_sorted_points . append ( sorted_point ) # Add the points to the plot self . tax . scatter ( new_sorted_points , linewidth = 1.0 , marker = \"o\" , color = \"red\" ) return new_sorted_points If we print the returned values, we get the following output, where each tuple is arranged in ascending order according to the x values: [(2.0, 2.0, 96.0), (2.5, 6.0, 91.5), (3.0, 10.0, 87.0), (3.5000000000000004, 16.0, 80.5), (4.0, 20.0, 76.0), (4.5, 25.0, 70.5), (5.0, 30.0, 65.0), (7.000000000000001, 36.0, 56.99999999999999), (9.0, 40.0, 51.0), (14.000000000000002, 48.0, 38.0), (33.0, 49.0, 18.0), (49.0, 40.0, 11.0), (62.0, 30.0, 8.0), (68.0, 26.0, 6.0), (74.5, 20.0, 5.5), (79.0, 17.0, 4.0), (83.0, 13.0, 4.0), (88.0, 9.0, 3.0), (91.0, 6.0, 3.0), (95.0, 3.0, 2.0), (97.0, 1.0, 2.0)] We can then call the plot function, to plot the ternary phase diagram in order to visualize the plotted points. def plot ( self ): self . tax . clear_matplotlib_ticks () self . tax . get_axes () . axis ( \"off\" ) self . tax . legend () ternary . plt . show () We obtain the ternary plot shown below: We define the composition_line function which plots equilibrium lines joining the tuples corresponding to the two compositions in each index in the list of tuples. This function first multiplies each point in each tuple by the scale, then sorts the list of the left composition in ascending order, and the list of the right composition in descending order. For each tuple, the x, y and z values are extracted, then joined using equilibrium lines. def composition_line ( self , left_eq_line , right_eq_line ): # Multiply each point by the scale new_left_eq_line = [ ( x * self . scale , y * self . scale , z * self . scale ) for x , y , z in left_eq_line ] new_right_eq_line = [ ( x * self . scale , y * self . scale , z * self . scale ) for x , y , z in right_eq_line ] # Sort the left points in ascending order xyz = [( x , y , z ) for x , y , z in new_left_eq_line ] sorted_left_eq_line = sorted ( xyz , key = lambda m : m [ 0 ]) # Sort the right points in descending order xyz = [( x , y , z ) for x , y , z in new_right_eq_line ] sorted_right_eq_line = sorted ( xyz , key = lambda m : m [ 0 ], reverse = True ) for i in range ( len ( left_eq_line )): # Ensure all points add up to the scale pointA = sorted_left_eq_line [ i ] assert sum ( pointA ) == self . scale pointB = sorted_right_eq_line [ i ] assert sum ( pointB ) == self . scale # Extract x and y coordinates of each point xA , yA , zA = pointA xB , yB , zB = pointB # Add the two points to the plot self . tax . scatter ([( xA , yA , zA ), ( xB , yB , zB )], marker = \"s\" , color = \"red\" ) # Plot a line connecting the two points self . tax . plot ( [( xA , yA , zA ), ( xB , yB , zB )], linewidth = 1.0 , color = \"blue\" , ) We obtain the following ternary plot: We can calculate the slope of the equilibrium lines plotted above using the function eq_slope . We loop through each tuple of each composition in each index, extract the x and y values, and find the slope, by dividing the change in y by the change in x for each index. The function returns the average slope. def eq_slope ( self , right_eq_line , left_eq_line ): # Multiply each point by the scale right_eq_line = [ ( x * self . scale , y * self . scale , z * self . scale ) for x , y , z in right_eq_line ] left_eq_line = [ ( x * self . scale , y * self . scale , z * self . scale ) for x , y , z in left_eq_line ] # Sort the right points in ascending order xyz = [( x , y , z ) for x , y , z in right_eq_line ] right_eq = sorted ( xyz , key = lambda m : m [ 0 ]) # Sort the left points in descending order xyz = [( x , y , z ) for x , y , z in left_eq_line ] left_eq = sorted ( xyz , key = lambda m : m [ 0 ], reverse = True ) slopes = [] for i in range ( len ( right_eq_line )): pointA = right_eq [ i ] assert sum ( pointA ) == self . scale pointB = left_eq [ i ] assert sum ( pointB ) == self . scale # Extract x and y coordinates of each point xA , yA , _ = pointA xB , yB , _ = pointB # Calculate the slope of the line joining the points if xA - xB != 0 : # Check for vertical line slope = ( yA - yB ) / ( xA - xB ) slopes . append ( slope ) else : # For vertical lines, return None for slope slopes . append ( 0 ) print ( \"Slope = \" , slopes ) # Calculate average of the slopes avg_slope = sum ( slopes ) / len ( slopes ) print ( \"Average slope = \" , avg_slope ) return avg_slope We obtain the following output: Slope = [-0.010526315789473684, -0.032432432432432434, -0.045454545454545456, -0.08284023668639054, -0.08860759493670886, -0.10738255033557047, -0.14388489208633093, -0.16393442622950818, -0.18867924528301888, -0.22857142857142856, 0] Average slope = -0.09930124252776436 We can also plot a ternary phase diagram with an equilibrium line joining all the plotted points, like in a graph, by calling the add_eq_line function. def add_eq_line ( self , right_eq_line , left_eq_line ): # Add the points self . right_eq_line = self . sort_points ( right_eq_line ) self . left_eq_line = self . sort_points ( left_eq_line ) eq_line = self . right_eq_line + self . left_eq_line # Remove duplicate points eq_line_plot = list ( set ( eq_line )) # Sort the points in ascending order xyz = [( x , y , z ) for x , y , z in eq_line_plot ] sorted_eq = sorted ( xyz , key = lambda m : m [ 0 ]) self . tax . plot ( sorted_eq , linewidth = 1.0 , color = \"blue\" , label = \"Equilibrium line\" ) We get the ternary plot below: However, the equilibrium line plotted above is not smooth. To generate a smooth line, we use the interpolate_points function. We first sort the points using the sort_points function. Then we extract the x and y values from the sorted points, ignoring the z values which will not be used. Variable x becomes a list of all x values and variable y becomes a list of all y values. After that, we perform cubic spline interpolation on the x and y values using the CubicSpline function, imported from the scipy.interpolate module of SciPy's library [ 2 ]. bc_type=\"natural\" specifies the natural boundary conditions, meaning the second derivative of the spline at the boundaries will be set to zero. x_cubic is set to a linearly spaced array of values ranging from 0 to 100 with 100 number of points, which is the value of self.scale , and y_cubic contains the corresponding y values interpolated using the cubic spline function f . Then we filter out any points outside the specified range of 0 to 100 for both x_cubic and y_cubic , and use the np.column_stack function to combine x_cubic and y_cubic into a single 2D array, which is returned by the function as interpolated_points . def interpolate_points ( self , points ): sorted_points = self . sort_points ( points ) # Cubic spline interpolation x = [ x for x , y , _ in sorted_points ] y = [ y for x , y , _ in sorted_points ] f = CubicSpline ( x , y , bc_type = \"natural\" ) x_cubic = np . linspace ( 0 , self . scale , self . scale ) y_cubic = f ( x_cubic ) # Remove negative points interpolated_points = [ [ i , j ] for i , j in np . column_stack (( x_cubic , y_cubic )) if 0 <= i <= self . scale and 0 <= j <= self . scale ] return interpolated_points Printing the output of the function, we obtain the output below, showing the interpolated points: [[2.0202020202020203, 2.1691472640742586], [3.0303030303030303, 10.329514857514697], [4.040404040404041, 20.340775738329878], [5.050505050505051, 30.41604117022922], [6.0606060606060606, 34.9725244736696], [7.070707070707071, 36.0788150823154], [8.080808080808081, 37.866519430111914], [9.090909090909092, 40.207639450509895], [10.101010101010102, 42.33305618527275], [11.111111111111112, 44.15164951408806], [12.121212121212121, 45.70152886497335], [13.131313131313131, 47.02080366594621], [14.141414141414142, 48.147569717383064], [15.151515151515152, 49.11261947676193], [16.161616161616163, 49.927423194367556], [17.171717171717173, 50.600292249170636], [18.181818181818183, 51.13953802014185], [19.191919191919194, 51.55347188625187], [20.202020202020204, 51.850405226471395], [21.212121212121215, 52.038649419771076], [22.222222222222225, 52.12651584512162], [23.232323232323235, 52.122315881493684], [24.242424242424242, 52.03436090785797], [25.252525252525253, 51.87096230318516], [26.262626262626263, 51.640431446445916], [27.272727272727273, 51.35107971661092], [28.282828282828284, 51.011218492650855], [29.292929292929294, 50.62915915353641], [30.303030303030305, 50.213213078238255], [31.313131313131315, 49.771691645727074], [32.323232323232325, 49.31290623497355], [33.333333333333336, 48.84510804535748], [34.343434343434346, 48.37284930204433], [35.35353535353536, 47.89489752249601], [36.36363636363637, 47.409516570717145], [37.37373737373738, 46.91497031071236], [38.38383838383839, 46.40952260648627], [39.3939393939394, 45.891437322043494], [40.40404040404041, 45.358978321388655], [41.41414141414142, 44.81040946852637], [42.42424242424243, 44.24399462746127], [43.43434343434344, 43.65799766219796], [44.44444444444445, 43.050682436741056], [45.45454545454546, 42.4203128150952], [46.46464646464647, 41.765152661265006], [47.47474747474748, 41.083465839255076], [48.484848484848484, 40.373516213070054], [49.494949494949495, 39.63371670174959], [50.505050505050505, 38.86607499990182], [51.515151515151516, 38.076288591118626], [52.525252525252526, 37.270223020764256], [53.535353535353536, 36.45374383420295], [54.54545454545455, 35.63271657679892], [55.55555555555556, 34.81300679391643], [56.56565656565657, 34.000480030919704], [57.57575757575758, 33.201001833172974], [58.58585858585859, 32.42043774604049], [59.5959595959596, 31.664653314886465], [60.60606060606061, 30.93951408507516], [61.61616161616162, 30.250885601970786], [62.62626262626263, 29.60336029919871], [63.63636363636364, 28.983912044764498], [64.64646464646465, 28.366648419185424], [65.65656565656566, 27.72538388514391], [66.66666666666667, 27.0339329053224], [67.67676767676768, 26.26610994240331], [68.68686868686869, 25.39917799115036], [69.6969696969697, 24.44860975371087], [70.70707070707071, 23.453665293050822], [71.71717171717172, 22.45396405508463], [72.72727272727273, 21.489125485726685], [73.73737373737374, 20.59876903089141], [74.74747474747475, 19.822230508859366], [75.75757575757576, 19.162761793258028], [76.76767676767678, 18.552564414178864], [77.77777777777779, 17.915539652280298], [78.7878787878788, 17.175588788220747], [79.7979797979798, 16.27016258697005], [80.80808080808082, 15.240129979240486], [81.81818181818183, 14.174027140890017], [82.82828282828284, 13.160644754568583], [83.83838383838385, 12.27416074496895], [84.84848484848486, 11.4905826393484], [85.85858585858587, 10.745488901010873], [86.86868686868688, 9.974332435176901], [87.87878787878789, 9.112566147067007], [88.8888888888889, 8.11684009659671], [89.89898989898991, 7.065697936762742], [90.90909090909092, 6.081168542871885], [91.91919191919193, 5.257512388433542], [92.92929292929294, 4.543021889369125], [93.93939393939395, 3.8382841183777483], [94.94949494949496, 3.043859233178794], [95.95959595959597, 2.0885249765853326], [96.96969696969697, 1.0322241687602192]] Next, we define a function, div_half , to divide an equilibrium line in half, and thus dividing the interpolated points in the left side from those in the right side.

Starting with an index value of zero and a minimum difference given by the difference between the absolute of the first dydx value and the average slope, we iterate over the indices of dydx to find the index of the dydx value which is closest to the average slope avg_slope . def min_diff ( self , right_eq_line , left_eq_line ): self . points = right_eq_line + left_eq_line dydx = self . derivative ( self . points ) avg_slope = self . eq_slope ( right_eq_line , left_eq_line ) min_index = 0 # Initialize min_diff_value with the first element difference min_diff_value = abs ( dydx [ 0 ][ 0 ] - avg_slope ) # Iterate over indices of dydx for index in range ( 0 , dydx . size ): diff = abs ( dydx [ 0 ][ index ] - avg_slope ) if diff < min_diff_value : min_diff_value = diff min_index = index return min_index We then define the div_half function that divides the equilibrium line precisely in half. We use the interpolated points from the interpolate_points function, which ensures that the point of division is very precise. Then we use the min_diff function to obtain the index of the point dividing the equilibrium line in half. Using this index, we can halve the interpolated points, and plot two equilibrium lines on the right and left side of the ternary plot using these points. def div_half ( self , right_eq_line , left_eq_line ): # Add the points self . points = right_eq_line + left_eq_line interpolated_points = self . interpolate_points ( self . points ) # Use index to separate right and left side index = self . min_diff ( right_eq_line , left_eq_line ) self . interpolated_right_side = interpolated_points [ index :] self . interpolated_left_side = interpolated_points [: index + 1 ] # Plot the curve self . tax . plot ( self . interpolated_right_side , linewidth = 1.0 , color = \"blue\" , label = \"Right interpolated curve\" , ) self . tax . plot ( self . interpolated_left_side , linewidth = 1.0 , color = \"orange\" , label = \"Left interpolated curve\" , ) We obtain the following ternary plot:","title":"Methods"},{"location":"blog/fqlearn-ternary-plot/#acknowledgements","text":"I would like to thank the Open Science Labs and The Graph Network for giving me the opportunity to learn and gain experience in open source through this internship.

This magic isn\u2019t hardcoded per-language into the editor. Instead, it\u2019s often powered by something called the Language Server Protocol (LSP) . Let\u2019s dive into what LSP is, why it exists, and how it powers modern development environments. What is the Language Server Protocol? # The Language Server Protocol (LSP) is a standardized way for development tools (like VS Code, Vim, or Emacs) to communicate with language-specific services (called language servers). Instead of writing new editor plugins for every language and every editor, LSP decouples the logic : The editor (client) handles the UI and editor behavior. The language server handles parsing, validation, completions, and other language-specific logic. They talk to each other via a common JSON-RPC protocol over standard input/output, TCP, or WebSockets. Why was LSP created? # Before LSP, supporting multiple languages across editors was a mess: Each editor needed custom plugins. Each language had to build and maintain these plugins. This was inefficient and hard to maintain. Microsoft introduced LSP in 2016 , alongside VS Code, to fix this fragmentation. Now, language authors can focus on building a single LSP server, and editors can plug into it easily. Core Features of LSP # Here are some features LSP enables out-of-the-box: Autocompletion Go to Definition Hover Information Diagnostics (errors/warnings) Formatting Find References Rename Symbol Signature Help These features work consistently across any editor that supports! How Does It Work? # Here's a simplified lifecycle of how an editor (client) talks to a language server: Editor launches the language server. Sends an initialize request to begin communication. As you edit: Sends textDocument/didOpen , didChange , or didSave . Receives back diagnostics or suggestions. On hover, completion, or definition jumps: Sends textDocument/hover , completion , or definition requests. Displays server responses in the UI. All of this happens over a well-defined set of JSON-RPC messages. Anatomy of a Language Server # A language server is just a program that: Parses the user\u2019s code (possibly building an AST or symbol table). Responds to LSP method calls. Tracks open files and their versions. Final Thoughts # The Language Server Protocol has quietly become the backbone of modern developer tooling . Whether you\u2019re building an IDE, a DSL, or a configuration tool, LSP lets you ship a polished editing experience with far less effort.

In our ongoing effort to enhance Makim's capabilities, we've introduced an exciting new feature\u2014the Working Directory. This feature brings a new level of control and flexibility to your project workflows. In this blog post, we'll explore the Working Directory feature, understand its syntax, and witness its power in action through real-world examples. Whether you're a Makim veteran or a newcomer, this feature is designed to make your command-line experience more flexible and tailored to your project's needs. Let's dive into the details and unleash the potential of Makim's Working Directory feature! Unveiling the attribute: working-directory # In the bustling realm of project management, one of the key challenges is orchestrating a seamless workflow while ensuring command executions are precisely where they need to be. This is where Makim's Working Directory steps into the spotlight, offering a robust solution for organizing, customizing, and optimizing your project commands. Syntax and Scopes # The Working Directory feature in Makim operates across three distinct scopes: Global, Group, and Target. 1. Global Scope At the global scope, setting the working directory impacts all targets and groups within the Makim configuration. It provides a top-level directive to establish a standardized execution environment. version : 1.0 working-directory : /path/to/global/directory # ... other configuration ... Group Scope Moving a level deeper, the group scope allows you to tailor the working directory for all targets within a specific group. version : 1.0 groups : my-group : working-directory : /path/to/group/directory targets : target-1 : run : | # This target operates within the /path/to/group/directory 3. Target Scope For fine-grained control over individual targets, the working directory can be specified at the target scope. version : 1.0 groups : my-group : targets : my-target : working-directory : /path/to/target/directory run : | # This target operates within the /path/to/target/directory The flexibility provided by these scopes ensures that your commands are executed in precisely the right context, maintaining a clean and organized project structure. Why is it helpful? # Embracing the Working Directory feature in Makim brings forth a multitude of advantages, enhancing the overall project management experience. Let's delve into why this feature is a game-changer for your Makim configurations: 1. Isolation of Commands: Users can isolate commands within specific directories, avoiding potential conflicts and ensuring that commands run in the expected environment. Flexibility in Configuration: Different targets or groups may require different execution environments. The working-directory attribute provides the flexibility to customize these environments, tailoring them to the unique needs of each segment of your project. Ease of Use: Users can easily understand and manage the execution context of commands within the Makim configuration. This makes the configuration more readable and maintainable, especially when dealing with complex project structures. Support for Absolute and Relative Paths: The feature supports both absolute and relative paths, allowing users to specify directories based on their requirements. This flexibility ensures compatibility with diverse project structures and simplifies the configuration process. Real-Life Example # Consider a scenario where a development team is working on a project that involves multiple programming languages and technologies. The project structure looks like this: multi_language_project/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 backend/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 python/ \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 src/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 java/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 src/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 frontend/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 react/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 src/ \u2514\u2500\u2500 vue/ \u2514\u2500\u2500 src/ The project consists of a backend with components implemented in both Python and Java, and a frontend with components using React and Vue.js. To efficiently manage and run tasks for each language or framework, the Working Directory feature proves invaluable. Let's create a Makim configuration file (.makim.yaml) that showcases the flexibility of the Working Directory feature in managing tasks for different languages. %% writefile . makim . yaml version : 1.0 working - directory : \"/tmp/multi_language_project\" groups : backend_python : working - directory : \"backend/python\" targets : test : run : | echo \"Running Python backend tests...\" # Add commands to run Python backend tests lint : run : | echo \"Linting Python code...\" # Add commands for linting Python code backend_java : working - directory : \"backend/java\" targets : test : working - directory : \"src\" run : | echo \"Running Java backend tests...\" # Add commands to run Java backend tests build : run : | echo \"Building Java artifacts...\" # Add commands for building Java artifacts frontend_react : working - directory : \"frontend/react\" targets : test : run : | echo \"Running React frontend tests...\" # Add commands to run React frontend tests build : run : | echo \"Building React frontend...\" # Add commands for building React frontend frontend_vue : working - directory : \"frontend/vue\" targets : test : run : | echo \"Running Vue.js frontend tests...\" # Add commands to run Vue.js frontend tests build : working - directory : \"src\" run : | echo \"Building Vue.js frontend...\" # Add commands for building Vue.js frontend OUTPUT Overwriting .makim.yaml ! makim -- makim - file ./. makim . yaml backend_python . lint ! makim -- makim - file ./. makim . yaml backend_java . test ! makim -- makim - file ./. makim . yaml frontend_react . test ! makim -- makim - file ./. makim . yaml frontend_vue . build OUTPUT Linting Python code...

I spent the summer after my second year doing my Google Summer of Code 2024 project with the NumFOCUS organization (which serves as an umbrella organization for open source projects), which had Open Science Labs as a sub organization. The project I worked on is: PyDataStructs . About PyDataStructs # PyDataStructs aims to be a Python package for various data structures in computer science. It also contains several algorithms including their parallel implementations. Everything is just a few calls away, and users don't need to write any code from scratch. The APIs provided are consistent with each other, clean and easy to use. All implementations are well tested, 99% lines of code have already been tested by developers. PyDataStructs is the first well-designed library/package which covers most of the data structures and algorithms, with different backends like Python and C++. My first contribution to open source # I began contributing to open source in December 2023, when I connected to a senior student at my university who had also done GSoC in 2023, with PyDataStructs. I was interested in the project that she did and hence I started exploring the codebase. Finding a good first issue # I went to the issues tab on the repository's github page and searched for good first issues. I noticed an issue that seemed doable: Implement Introsort . This involved implementing the sorting algorithm: Introsort in the Python backend. I had learned this as a part of my academic cousework, and hence, I was able to code this. My first Pull Request # I started reading the README file and set up the repository locally and created the conda environment. Then I got to work. In a day, I was able to successfully create a PR (pull request) and open it on GitHub: Implemented Introsort . This PR was reviewed and changes were requested. Once I had done all of them and all the CI checks passed, it was merged. And that's my first open souce contribution! Pre-GSoC Phase # Next, I connected to the maintainer, Gagandeep Singh , and expressed my interest for contributing. He suggested that I contribute to more organizations, like: LFortran and LPython to maximize my chances for GSoC. These organizations also had Gagandeep Sir as the core maintainer and developer. The amazing open source community # I found the open source community amazing, everyone was ready to help me with every doubt I had, patiently guide me with differnt git commands to resolve conflicts and review my PRs and give valueable advice. I made new friends, who were almost of the same age as me, who had been contributing since quite a while. They made things easier for me and helped me contribute. More open source contributions # I spent the next 3 months contributing to these organizations, and I had 10 merged PRs in the LFortran repository and 5 merged PRs in the LPython repository. Here's a link to these: LFortran contributions LPython contributions These made me well versed with various git commands, the skill of handling a large and dynamic codebase and communicating effectively with the community to incorporate suggestions and solve issues. Drafting my GSoC proposal # Next, it was time to submit proposals for GSoC projects. By then, I had been contributing to open source for nearly 3 months. I requested a meeting with Gagandeep Sir to help me decide my proposal. He kindly agreed and we set up an online meeting, where we discussed potential GSoC ideas and the timeline that was best suited for me. I submitted 2 proposals, to LPython (Python Software Foundation) and PyDataStructs (NumFOCUS): NumFOCUS - Open Science Labs: PyDataStructs: Add C++ Backend for all trees Python Software Foundation - LPython: Implement modules from the Python Standard Library The proposals should have personal information, details about previous open source contributions made to the organization's repository, and detailed information about the project that you wish to take up, with a structured plan about your goals. In addition to this, it must contain an expected timeline that you will follow. It's a good practice to set a large number of small goals and plan tasks before starting the project. Continuing open source contributions # It's a good practice to remain active in the organizations by contributing even after submitting GSoC proposals, this makes the developers believe that you are genuinely interested in the project and enthusiastic to contribute. This amplifies chances for getting selected for Google Summer of Code! GSoC Phase # I got my acceptance letter at 11:32 pm IST on May 1, 2024. It was 2 minutes past the result declaration time and I was at the edge of my seat. I was overjoyed to get the mail saying I was accepted as a Google Summer of Code contributor for NumFOCUS! Here's my project: Open Science Labs: PyDataStructs: Add a C++ Backend for tree data structures and their algorithms My GSoC project goals # My project involved adding a C++ backend for all tree data structures in PyDataStructs , a Python package for advanced data structures and algorithms. The user has an option to select either the Python backend or the C++ backend. tree = RedBlackTree ( backend = Backend . CPP ) For any data structure, the Python backend is developed first, and once completely tested and ready, its C++ backend is developed. Both the backends share full functionality and are completely compatible. The C++ backend is extremely fast, it executes codes 8-10 times faster. This enhances the computation speed, making it extremely valuable for scientific computing and high-performance applications. The community bonding period # I'll be honest, it was difficult at the start. I found the project a little more difficult than I had anticipated, and realized that it demanded a little more that my current skillset. My mentor, Gagandeep Sir, adviced me to read the documentation and first learn about Python-C API, which was something totally new for me. I spent the first week doing this, and I could barely write any code. However, I soon realized the importance of reading the documentation and how smoothly things went following that. Within a week, I became well versed with all the new technology and started coding up my first PR. Coding phase # I started working from the community bonding period itself, and this gave me a good headstart and allowed me to complete the project in 12 weeks.

In June 2024, I was privileged to be accepted for an internship at Open Science Labs. This program was mentored by Ivan Ogasawara , the founder of Open Science Labs and a seasoned professional with over 10 years of experience in open-source and 22 years of experience in software development. The Focus of My Internship Program # My internship at Open Science Labs was designed to be comprehensive. As such, I was introduced to: \u2022 software development project work \u2022 coding challenges \u2022 project/code reviews \u2022 open-source events \u2022 weekly open study group sessions \u2022 Relevant online courses \u2022 personal study sessions My First Contribution to Open Source # My first open-source contribution was a bug fix for an issue pointed out by the linter in the Growth Forge repository. Here is a link to the PR: https://github.com/osl-incubator/growth-forge/pull/9 As a pre-requirement for participating in the OSL internship, potential candidates are to make, at least, one simple contribution. My mentor directed me to the open \u2018linter\u2019 issue on the Growth Forge repo, informing me that it was simple enough to start with. I took a look at the issue and was able to run pre-commit hooks to fix the linter problem. About My Internship # During my internship program, I worked on some of the most amazing incubated and affiliated projects under the OSL umbrella. Here\u2019s a list of the repositories I engaged with and some of my activities. Project Work # Growth Forge: My contribution to the Growth Forge repository involved creating test codes for the project\u2019s views and models and running the respective tests, as well as recording the results. OSL Website: For the OSL website repository, I engaged in backend updates of several pages, including the home, team, events, and blogs pages. I also added a few new pages such as the career page, and worked to implement a website-wide search feature. Artbox: I utilized the Artbox text-to-speech feature to generate audio summaries of the monthly newsletter. These audios were applied to the OSL podcast. Aside from coding activities and project work, I also contributed by identifying and raising issues, particularly in the Artbox repository. Contribution Stats # Two statistics that define my internship contribution are: 21 merged pull requests and Python being the dominant programming language. OSL and Advent of Code Challenges # I attempted several challenges from the OSL Challenge repo including the train, padlock-secret, and money-calculation challenges. I also participated in solving Advent of Code 2024 challenges themed around finding a missing Santa using sketchy direction clues. Course Completions # Continuous learning is at the core of the OSL internship program. As such, I undertook several online courses, to enhance my understanding of coding concepts and learn new things altogether. Some of the courses I undertook during my internship were: Version Control with Git (available on Software Carpentry ), Docker Training Course for the Absolute Beginner (available on KodeKloud ), and Python for Everyone (available on Runestone Academy ). Open Source Events # Finding and participating in open-source events was another highlight of my internship journey. In October, I applied and received a scholarship to participate in the maiden edition of the pyOpenSci Fall Festival . This event featured interactive sessions on writing modular, clean code, building a Python package, and creating reproducible reports and presentations with Quarto and Great Tables. Open Study Calls # My mentor, Ivan Ogasawara, invited me to join the LiteRev-sponsored Open Study Calls every Thursday. Here, I came across several new concepts/tools such as Retrieval-Augumented Generation (RAG), JupyterLabs, etc. After participating in more than 20 Open Study Calls, I built a culture of learning, was exposed to expert suggestions and reviews, and came across relevant courses and resources on coding and software development in general. Impact of the Open Source and Open Science Community # Support from the open-source and open-science community proved handy throughout my internship at Open Science Labs. The OSL Discord server was a place where I could throw questions and get prompt and helpful responses from a number of experts. This significantly lightened the burden of finding my footing as a beginner in software development. Lessons Learnt # There are numerous lessons to be learnt from an impactful internship like the one I had at Open Science Labs (OSL). I\u2019ll share them with you. \u2022 Be Open to Corrections: Seek corrections. At the beginning, it might be difficult or overwhelming. However, with time, you will be grateful for it. Having someone to correct you will only make your learning process easy as you can quickly move on from mistakes and avoid them in the future. \u2022 Be Upfront about Challenges: The Open Science Labs internship is designed to be safe, warm, and welcoming. If you happen to have challenges during the program, it is okay to speak up about it. In fact, you should speak up about it. This will help your mentor/program coordinator make necessary adjustments, enabling your continued participation and progress. \u2022 Put Your Mind In the Work: If you like your work, it becomes easier. One notable way to build this liking is to put your mind to it. Your focus will easily translate into an interest, improving the quality of your participation and your output in general.","title":"My Open Science Labs Internship Journey"},{"location":"blog/my-opensciencelabs-internship-journey/#about-me","text":"I am Mfonobong Uyah , a graduate of Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) from the Federal University of Technology, Akure (FUTA).

The idea was simple: help researchers bring open science into their daily work. After a few months, life took me in other directions, and OSL went on pause. In 2018, a few friends were looking for their first jobs in tech. I decided to reactivate OSL (back then called Open Data Science Labs ) to support them with mentoring and internships, and to connect them to open source projects in research settings. Through this initiative, my friends Sandro Loch and Elton Santana started contributing to a scientific project I had previously worked on: Alerta Dengue , led by professor Flavio Coelho . A few months later, both of them were hired. That was the real beginning of OSL. It matched what moves me most: helping people grow while helping open source projects move forward. Growing together # From there, OSL started many kinds of activities: mentoring, open source incubation, internships, translations, webinars, and more. We received support from wonderful people and friends like Francisco Palm , Mariangela Petrizzo , Ever Vino , Eunice Rodas , Luis Gago , Agustina Pesce , Sandro Loch , and many others. New interns joined too, such as Lu\u00e3 Bida , Anavelyz Perez , and Yurely Camacho , who helped keep many internal projects moving. Later, Anavelyz also helped coordinate our activities related to Google Summer of Code (GSoC) . And speaking of GSoC, we are deeply grateful to Gagandeep Singh for his guidance and support over the years. Our partners along the way # OSL also received direct and indirect support from several partners, including: Alerta Dengue , The GRAPH Network , The GRAPH Courses , pyOpenSci , LiteRev , and IGDORE . A big thank you to Olivia Keiser , Sara Botero , Flavio Coelho , Aziza , Erol Orel , and many others for the opportunities and trust. We are also very grateful to the Python Software Foundation , which supported us with three grants to help maintain three affiliated projects: SciCookie , Makim , and ASTx . These grants allowed us to hire amazing former interns like Anavelyz , Yurely , Abhijeet , and Ana Paula . The game changer: Google Summer of Code # A big turning point for our community was joining the Google Summer of Code program. In the first two years, we joined GSoC under the umbrella of NumFOCUS , who opened the doors for us. Later, in 2025, OSL was accepted as an official GSoC Mentoring Organization . GSoC put us \u201con the map\u201d for newcomers, which has always been one of our main audiences. Many new people started reaching out to participate in GSoC with OSL. This was beautiful\u2014but also challenging. We were not fully prepared for such a large number of candidates. It was hard to manage, and we learned a lot in the process. GSoC 2026 has not yet been announced, and we are already receiving messages from new candidates. This is one of the reasons we felt the need to pause, look at ourselves, and clarify our mission, motivation, and purpose. We want to make these clear and public so that people join us because they connect with our values, not only because of GSoC. Otherwise, many might feel disappointed, since only a few can be selected each year. You can read more about our mission, motivation, and purpose here . Below is a short summary. Our core: Growth, Collaboration, Impact # The three core values that represent our community are: Growth Collaboration Impact We are building a community where anyone who shares these values has a space to: Learn and grow Contribute to real projects Create a positive impact in the world We truly believe that open source is a powerful way to connect people who want experience with maintainers who need contributors. Today, only a small fraction of students manage to work in the field they studied after finishing university. That's the gap OSL is trying to help fill. We don't want followers, we want leaders # The focus of OSL is not to create followers, but to help people become leaders . We want people in our community who feel our projects as their projects, with the same love and passion that we put into them. Of course, each person grows at their own pace. It can take time to understand the architecture, roadmap, and purpose of a project. It can also take time before you feel confident to contribute independently or receive an invitation to become a maintainer. That's normal. Don't give up. Keep moving forward. Ask for feedback. Use every step to grow. As Jim Kwik says in his Super Brain course: \u201cPractice doesn't make perfect. Practice makes progress.\u201d Thank you \ud83d\udc9a # Before closing, I want to say a special thank you to some amazing collaborators who have helped us more actively in different projects and initiatives: Sandro Loch , Ever Vino , Felipe Paes , Satarupa Deb , Yuvi Mittal , Aniket Kumar , Abhijeet , and all our interns, mentors, former steering council members, and partners. Thank you all for being part of our lives and our journey. Together, we are building a welcoming place where people can grow, contribute, and make a real difference.

La propuesta se hizo con la finalidad de contribuir con el desarrollo y mantenimiento de SciCookie, una herramienta de Python que se encuentra dentro de los proyectos de incubaci\u00f3n de OSL . Comenzaremos con una breve introducci\u00f3n a SciCookie, algunas de sus caracter\u00edsticas clave y aspectos de inter\u00e9s. Luego, discutiremos el proceso de solicitud de la subvenci\u00f3n y haremos algunas reflexiones sobre la experiencia y lo que aprendimos. \u00bfQu\u00e9 es SciCookie? # Como te mencionamos al inicio, SciCookie es una herramienta de Python dise\u00f1ada para proveer una plantilla de proyecto Python. Sus principales objetivos son simplificar el proceso de creaci\u00f3n de tus proyectos y ahorrarte una cantidad considerable de tiempo porque, de acuerdo a tus necesidades y planificaci\u00f3n, te da un punto de partida para la configuraci\u00f3n de tu proyecto. SciCookie proporciona varias herramientas lo m\u00e1s actualizadas posibles, adem\u00e1s se adhiere a los est\u00e1ndares de la comunidad. Esto \u00faltimo es porque SciCookie, se basa principalmente en las recomendaciones de PyOpenSci en lo que se refiere a las herramientas, bibliotecas, mejores pr\u00e1cticas y flujos de trabajo empleados por los grupos cient\u00edficos significativos de Python. Los elementos que mencionamos se encuentran como opciones, lo que significa puedes adaptar diversos enfoques en tu proyecto, mediante una interfaz de texto (TUI) que te proporciona SciCookie. SciCookie est\u00e1 disponible en PyPI y conda . Tambi\u00e9n puedes visitar su repositorio en GitHub . Ahora que ya conoces un poco sobre este proyecto, te contamos un poco sobre PSF y c\u00f3mo apoya a la comunidad Python. \u00bfQu\u00e9 es PSF y c\u00f3mo apoya a la comunidad? # La Python Software Foundation (PSF) es una organizaci\u00f3n dedicada al avance y mejora de las tecnolog\u00edas de c\u00f3digo abierto. Su misi\u00f3n es promover, proteger e impulsar el lenguaje de programaci\u00f3n Python. Adem\u00e1s, apoya y facilita el desarrollo/crecimiento de la comunidad de programadores Python; una comunidad diversa e internacional. Entre los programas que promueve PSF para lograr su misi\u00f3n, se encuentra un Grants Program (programa de subvenciones), donde las propuestas para proyectos relacionados con el desarrollo de Python, tecnolog\u00edas asociadas a este lenguaje de programaci\u00f3n y recursos educacionales, son bienvenidas. Desde la creaci\u00f3n del programa, PSF ha apoyado varios proyectos interesantes, puedes hacer clic aqu\u00ed para ver la lista o tengas una noci\u00f3n m\u00e1s clara de las propuestas, y quiz\u00e1 te animes a aplicar con nuevos proyectos o ideas. Continuando con el programa de subvenciones, debes conocer que la PSF eval\u00faa una serie de aspectos en cada propuesta, entre ellos la utilidad del proyecto y el impacto en la comunidad Python. En caso de que desees conocer m\u00e1s, te recomendamos visitar el espacio que tiene PSF en su p\u00e1gina web para el grants Program . Hasta ahora y de manera resumida, te hemos relatado los principales aspectos sobre las dos partes involucradas: SciCookie y PSF. Proseguiremos cont\u00e1ndote sobre la solicitud de la subvenci\u00f3n, lo que nos motiv\u00f3 y la divisi\u00f3n de nuestras tareas. \u00bfC\u00f3mo fue el proceso de solicitud del grant o subvenci\u00f3n? # El proceso de solicitud de subvenci\u00f3n de la PSF fue un proceso largo y desafiante, pero tambi\u00e9n muy gratificante. Comenz\u00f3 con una cuidadosa planificaci\u00f3n e investigaci\u00f3n. Deb\u00edamos comprender las necesidades de la comunidad cient\u00edfica y encontrar un proyecto que pudiese ayudar a satisfacerlas. Es decir, se requer\u00eda desarrollar un caso s\u00f3lido para la subvenci\u00f3n. En vista de esto, hicimos un estudio de los distintos proyectos dentro del programa de incubaci\u00f3n de Open Science Labs; donde hay diferentes enfoques y tecnolog\u00edas implementadas, incluyendo proyectos en Python asociados a DevOps, Data Science, y proyectos cient\u00edficos. La opci\u00f3n que mejor se adapt\u00f3 para solicitar la subvenci\u00f3n en nuestro caso fue SciCookie; porque es una herramienta bastante \u00fatil y se encuentra enfocada en ayudar a la comunidad Python. Despu\u00e9s de completar la planificaci\u00f3n y la investigaci\u00f3n, comenzamos el proceso de solicitud formal. Esto incluy\u00f3 completar un formulario en l\u00ednea y presentar una propuesta detallada. La propuesta contiene una descripci\u00f3n del proyecto, un cronograma, un presupuesto y una secci\u00f3n de impacto. En nuestro caso y para revisar con detenimiento cada aspecto elaboramos un archivo con las respuestas [1] y llenamos el esquema del presupuesto (plantilla proporcionada por la PSF). Este proceso se hizo bajo la asesor\u00eda del Steering Council de OSL. Adem\u00e1s de lo anterior, se crearon y editaron una serie de issues en el repositorio del proyecto, para tener claras las actividades a realizar y el tiempo que tomar\u00eda desarrollarlas en caso de que fuese aprobada la solicitud. Una vez realizada la presentaci\u00f3n de la propuesta por nuestra parte, tuvimos que esperar varios meses para recibir una decisi\u00f3n. Fue un per\u00edodo de gran incertidumbre, pero finalmente recibimos la noticia de que nuestra propuesta hab\u00eda sido \u00a1aceptada! \u00bfC\u00f3mo fue el flujo de trabajo? # Con la subvenci\u00f3n de la PSF, pudimos comenzar a desarrollar y mantener SciCookie a medio tiempo. Trabajamos con algunos desarrolladores de la comunidad para agregar nuevas funcionalidades, mejorar la documentaci\u00f3n y corregir errores o bugs. Entre esto destacamos la creaci\u00f3n de una gu\u00eda de usuario para ayudar a los entusiastas y desarrolladores a aprender a utilizar SciCookie. En cuanto la especificaci\u00f3n de las tareas, como te mencionamos en la secci\u00f3n anterior, se crearon una serie de issues en el repositorio del proyecto, y en base en esto cada una resolv\u00eda semanalmente varios de los issues mediante Pull Requests (PRs). Estos eran aprobados por miembros del equipo de Open Science Labs, qui\u00e9nes adem\u00e1s estuvieron al pendiente durante toda la ejecuci\u00f3n de la propuesta. Siendo un poco m\u00e1s espec\u00edficas sobre el seguimiento, tuvimos desde una reuni\u00f3n inicial donde abordamos los aspectos fundamentales del proyecto y configuramos lo necesario para llevarlo a cabo, hasta reuniones semanales para presentar nuestros avances, verificar si se nos hab\u00eda presentado alguna traba o duda que no nos permitiera avanzar. As\u00ed mismo, cada PR era revisado y si exist\u00eda alguna observaci\u00f3n, ten\u00edamos feedback sobre esto. En resumen, te podemos decir que fue un flujo de trabajo bastante din\u00e1mico, donde se construy\u00f3 un espacio amigable y nos permiti\u00f3 aprender bastante. Aprovechamos este espacio para agradecer a Ivan Ogasawara y a Ever Vino , por su tiempo y dedicaci\u00f3n. Ambos son miembros activos de OSL y parte del steering council; estuvieron apoy\u00e1ndonos y aclarando nuestras dudas. A continuaci\u00f3n te contamos sobre nuestra experiencia y la etapa de colaboraci\u00f3n. \u00bfC\u00f3mo fue nuestro proceso de aprendizaje? # SciCookie nos brind\u00f3, por primera vez, la oportunidad de hacer una contribuci\u00f3n tan significativa en un proyecto de ciencia abierta y open source. Tambi\u00e9n nos permiti\u00f3 adquirir nuevos conocimientos sobre algunos aspectos y tecnolog\u00edas ligadas al lenguaje de programaci\u00f3n Python, ya que en ese momento, nuestros conocimientos estaban m\u00e1s orientados al uso de bibliotecas, objetos, bucles, entre otros. Sobre este proceso de aprendizaje podemos decirte que desconoc\u00edamos muchas cosas y fue necesario aprender en el camino, en ocasiones esto se nos torn\u00f3 un poco desafiante pero, en general, muy provechoso. Entre las an\u00e9cdotas que rescatamos est\u00e1 que, un par de veces, nos \u201cexplot\u00f3\u201d el c\u00f3digo y no sab\u00edamos el porqu\u00e9; la causa era que no sab\u00edamos el uso exacto de comillas simples o dobles, doble llaves, espacios o tabulaciones dentro de la plantilla. Pero ya luego pudimos avanzar e incluso hicimos mejoras en el workflow del proyecto. Con relaci\u00f3n a esto \u00faltimo, sin duda podemos comentarte que las curvas de aprendizaje siempre son empinadas. Al principio ves todo cuesta arriba, pero cuando ya est\u00e1s familiarizado con la tecnolog\u00eda y las herramientas, todo se vuelve m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil. Atreverse siempre es el primer paso. Por otro lado, si te interesa colaborar en proyectos de c\u00f3digo abierto, es vital tener conocimientos b\u00e1sicos de herramientas de control de versiones Git y GitHub, y entender sus comandos esenciales como git pull, git push, git rebase, git log, git stash, entre otros. Tambi\u00e9n puedes necesitar conocimientos sobre conda y poetry. Nosotras adem\u00e1s de esto, aprendimos un poco de jinja2 y make, y repasamos conocimientos de creaci\u00f3n de funciones, evaluaci\u00f3n de condicionales, workflow de GitHub, aspectos de documentaci\u00f3n y algunas tecnolog\u00edas asociadas a esto. En resumen, la experiencia de solicitar y ejecutar una subvenci\u00f3n de la PSF fue una experiencia valiosa. Aprendimos mucho sobre el proceso, c\u00f3mo desarrollar y mantener una herramienta de Python, qu\u00e9 estructura debe tener un proyecto de biblioteca o paquete Python y c\u00f3mo construir una comunidad alrededor de un proyecto de c\u00f3digo abierto. Tambi\u00e9n estamos agradecidos por el apoyo de la PSF, que nos ha permitido hacer un aporte a SciCookie. Nos sentimos satisfechas del trabajo que hemos realizado y estamos emocionadas por el futuro de esta herramienta. A todo lo que te hemos comentado, le sumamos una invitaci\u00f3n a que colabores en proyectos de c\u00f3digo abierto o ciencia abierta y, si ya lo has hecho, te animamos a que contin\u00faes haci\u00e9ndolo. A nosotras muchas veces nos motivaba el hecho de ver nuestros PRs siendo aprobados, compartimos sentimientos de logro y nuevos retos y, lo m\u00e1s importante es que estuvimos aplicando lo que promueve el open source o c\u00f3digo abierto: peque\u00f1as colaboraciones hacen grandes cambios y van sumando a los proyectos, logrando buenos y \u00fatiles resultados. Luego de todo esto, quiz\u00e1 te puedas preguntar sobre las barreras en la colaboraci\u00f3n.

Comenz\u00f3 con una cuidadosa planificaci\u00f3n e investigaci\u00f3n. Deb\u00edamos comprender las necesidades de la comunidad cient\u00edfica y encontrar un proyecto que pudiese ayudar a satisfacerlas. Es decir, se requer\u00eda desarrollar un caso s\u00f3lido para la subvenci\u00f3n. En vista de esto, hicimos un estudio de los distintos proyectos dentro del programa de incubaci\u00f3n de Open Science Labs; donde hay diferentes enfoques y tecnolog\u00edas implementadas, incluyendo proyectos en Python asociados a DevOps, Data Science, y proyectos cient\u00edficos. La opci\u00f3n que mejor se adapt\u00f3 para solicitar la subvenci\u00f3n en nuestro caso fue SciCookie; porque es una herramienta bastante \u00fatil y se encuentra enfocada en ayudar a la comunidad Python. Despu\u00e9s de completar la planificaci\u00f3n y la investigaci\u00f3n, comenzamos el proceso de solicitud formal. Esto incluy\u00f3 completar un formulario en l\u00ednea y presentar una propuesta detallada. La propuesta contiene una descripci\u00f3n del proyecto, un cronograma, un presupuesto y una secci\u00f3n de impacto. En nuestro caso y para revisar con detenimiento cada aspecto elaboramos un archivo con las respuestas [1] y llenamos el esquema del presupuesto (plantilla proporcionada por la PSF). Este proceso se hizo bajo la asesor\u00eda del Steering Council de OSL. Adem\u00e1s de lo anterior, se crearon y editaron una serie de issues en el repositorio del proyecto, para tener claras las actividades a realizar y el tiempo que tomar\u00eda desarrollarlas en caso de que fuese aprobada la solicitud. Una vez realizada la presentaci\u00f3n de la propuesta por nuestra parte, tuvimos que esperar varios meses para recibir una decisi\u00f3n. Fue un per\u00edodo de gran incertidumbre, pero finalmente recibimos la noticia de que nuestra propuesta hab\u00eda sido \u00a1aceptada!","title":"\u00bfC\u00f3mo fue el proceso de solicitud del grant o subvenci\u00f3n?"},{"location":"blog/psf-funding-open-source-projects-development-scicookie/#como-fue-el-flujo-de-trabajo","text":"Con la subvenci\u00f3n de la PSF, pudimos comenzar a desarrollar y mantener SciCookie a medio tiempo. Trabajamos con algunos desarrolladores de la comunidad para agregar nuevas funcionalidades, mejorar la documentaci\u00f3n y corregir errores o bugs. Entre esto destacamos la creaci\u00f3n de una gu\u00eda de usuario para ayudar a los entusiastas y desarrolladores a aprender a utilizar SciCookie. En cuanto la especificaci\u00f3n de las tareas, como te mencionamos en la secci\u00f3n anterior, se crearon una serie de issues en el repositorio del proyecto, y en base en esto cada una resolv\u00eda semanalmente varios de los issues mediante Pull Requests (PRs). Estos eran aprobados por miembros del equipo de Open Science Labs, qui\u00e9nes adem\u00e1s estuvieron al pendiente durante toda la ejecuci\u00f3n de la propuesta. Siendo un poco m\u00e1s espec\u00edficas sobre el seguimiento, tuvimos desde una reuni\u00f3n inicial donde abordamos los aspectos fundamentales del proyecto y configuramos lo necesario para llevarlo a cabo, hasta reuniones semanales para presentar nuestros avances, verificar si se nos hab\u00eda presentado alguna traba o duda que no nos permitiera avanzar. As\u00ed mismo, cada PR era revisado y si exist\u00eda alguna observaci\u00f3n, ten\u00edamos feedback sobre esto.

Tambi\u00e9n nos permiti\u00f3 adquirir nuevos conocimientos sobre algunos aspectos y tecnolog\u00edas ligadas al lenguaje de programaci\u00f3n Python, ya que en ese momento, nuestros conocimientos estaban m\u00e1s orientados al uso de bibliotecas, objetos, bucles, entre otros. Sobre este proceso de aprendizaje podemos decirte que desconoc\u00edamos muchas cosas y fue necesario aprender en el camino, en ocasiones esto se nos torn\u00f3 un poco desafiante pero, en general, muy provechoso. Entre las an\u00e9cdotas que rescatamos est\u00e1 que, un par de veces, nos \u201cexplot\u00f3\u201d el c\u00f3digo y no sab\u00edamos el porqu\u00e9; la causa era que no sab\u00edamos el uso exacto de comillas simples o dobles, doble llaves, espacios o tabulaciones dentro de la plantilla. Pero ya luego pudimos avanzar e incluso hicimos mejoras en el workflow del proyecto. Con relaci\u00f3n a esto \u00faltimo, sin duda podemos comentarte que las curvas de aprendizaje siempre son empinadas. Al principio ves todo cuesta arriba, pero cuando ya est\u00e1s familiarizado con la tecnolog\u00eda y las herramientas, todo se vuelve m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil. Atreverse siempre es el primer paso. Por otro lado, si te interesa colaborar en proyectos de c\u00f3digo abierto, es vital tener conocimientos b\u00e1sicos de herramientas de control de versiones Git y GitHub, y entender sus comandos esenciales como git pull, git push, git rebase, git log, git stash, entre otros. Tambi\u00e9n puedes necesitar conocimientos sobre conda y poetry. Nosotras adem\u00e1s de esto, aprendimos un poco de jinja2 y make, y repasamos conocimientos de creaci\u00f3n de funciones, evaluaci\u00f3n de condicionales, workflow de GitHub, aspectos de documentaci\u00f3n y algunas tecnolog\u00edas asociadas a esto. En resumen, la experiencia de solicitar y ejecutar una subvenci\u00f3n de la PSF fue una experiencia valiosa.

The proposal was submitted to contribute to the development and maintenance of SciCookie, a Python tool within the OSL incubation projects . We'll begin by introducing SciCookie, highlighting its key features and aspects that might interest you. Then, we'll go over the grant application process and share our reflections on the experience, along with the lessons we learned. What is SciCookie? # As we mentioned at the beginning, SciCookie is a Python tool designed to provide a Python project template. Its main goals are to simplify the process of creating your projects and save you a considerable amount of time because, according to your needs and planning, it gives you a starting point for the configuration of your project. SciCookie provides several tools that are as up-to-date as possible and adheres to community standards. SciCookie is mainly based on PyOpenSci recommendations regarding the tools, libraries, best practices and workflows employed by the significant Python scientific groups. The elements we mention are listed as options, which means that you can adapt various approaches in your project, through a text interface (TUI) provided by SciCookie. SciCookie is available from PyPI and conda . You can also visit its repository at GitHub . Now that you know a bit about this project, let's tell you about PSF and how it supports the Python community. What is PSF and how does it support the Python community? # The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is an organization dedicated to the advancement and improvement of open source technologies. Its mission is to promote, protect and advance the Python programming language. In addition, it supports and facilitates the development/growth of the Python developers community; a diverse and international community. Among the programs that PSF promotes to achieve its mission, there is a Grants Program , where proposals for projects related to the development of Python, technologies associated with this programming language and educational resources, are welcome. Since the creation of the program, PSF has supported several interesting projects, you can click here to see the list or have a clearer notion of the proposals, and maybe you will be encouraged to apply with new projects or ideas. You should know that the PSF in the grants program evaluates a number of aspects in each proposal, including the usefulness of the project and the impact on the Python community. In case you want to know more, we recommend you visit the space that PSF has on its website for the grants program . So far, we have given you a brief overview of the main aspects of the two parties involved: SciCookie and PSF. We will continue by telling you about the grant application, what motivated us, the arranging and assigning tasks. What was the grant application process like? # The PSF grant application process was a long and challenging, but also very rewarding. It began with careful planning and research. We studied the needs of the scientific community and found a project that could help meet those needs. In other words, we build on a strong case for the grant. We were studying the different projects within the Open Science Labs incubation program; where there are a series of approaches and technologies implemented, including Python projects associated with DevOps, Data Science, and scientific projects. The option that was best suited to apply for the grant in our case was SciCookie; because it is a very useful tool and is focused on helping the Python community. After completing the planning and research, we began the formal application process. This included completing an online form and submitting a detailed proposal. The proposal contains a project description, timeline, budget and impact section. In our case and in order to review each aspect carefully, we produced a file with the responses [1] and filled in the budget scheme (template provided by the PSF). This process was done under the advice of the OSL Steering Council. In addition to the above, a series of issues were created and edited in the project repository, in order to be clear about the activities to be carried out and the time it would take to develop them in case the proposal was approved. Once we had submitted our proposal, we had to wait some months for a decision. It was a period of great uncertainty, but finally we received the news that our proposal had been accepted! How was the workflow? # With the PSF grant, we were able to start developing and maintaining SciCookie part-time. We worked with some community developers to add new features, improve documentation and fix bugs. This included the creation of a user guide to help enthusiasts and developers to use SciCookie. In terms of task specification, as we described in the previous section, a series of issues were generated in the project repository, and each one of us handled some of the issues on a weekly basis via Pull Requests (PRs). These were approved by members of the Open Science Labs team, who were also on hand throughout the execution of the proposal. Being a bit more specific about the follow-up, we had from an initial meeting where we discussed the fundamental aspects of the project and set up what was necessary to carry it out, to weekly meetings to present our progress, to check if we had any obstacles or doubts that did not allow us to move forward. Likewise, each PR was reviewed and if there were any observations, we had feedback on this. In summary, we can tell you that it was quite a dynamic workflow, where a friendly space was built and allowed us to learn a lot. We would like to take this opportunity to thank Ivan Ogasawara and to Ever Vino , for their time and dedication. Both are active members of OSL and members of the steering council; they were there to support us and clarify our questions. Here we tell you about our experience and the collaboration phase. How was our learning process? # SciCookie provided us, for the first time, with the opportunity to make such a significant contribution to an open science and open source project. It also allowed us to acquire new knowledge about some aspects and technologies linked to the Python programming language, since at that time, our knowledge was more oriented to the use of libraries, objects, loops, among others. About this learning process we can tell you that we did not know many things and it was necessary to learn along the way, sometimes this was a bit challenging but, in general, very profitable. Among the anecdotes that we rescued is that, a couple of times, we \"exploded\" the code and we didn't know why; the cause was that we didn't know the exact use of single or double quotes, double braces, spaces or tabs within the template. But then we were able to move forward and we even made improvements in the workflow of the project. Regarding the latter, we can certainly tell you that learning curves are always steep. At the beginning you see everything uphill, but when you are familiar with the technology and the tools, everything becomes easier. Daring is always the first step. On the other hand, if you are interested in collaborating on open source projects, it is vital to have basic knowledge of Git and GitHub version control tools, and to understand their essential commands such as git pull, git push, git rebase, git log, git stash, among others. You may also need knowledge of conda and poetry. We also learned a bit of jinja2 and make, and reviewed knowledge of function creation, conditional evaluation, GitHub workflow, documentation aspects and some of the technologies associated with it. In summary, the experience of applying for and executing a PSF grant was a valuable experience. We learned a lot about the process, how to develop and maintain a Python tool, what structure a Python library or package project should have, and how to build a community around an open source project. We are also grateful for the support of the PSF, which has allowed us to make a contribution to SciCookie. We feel satisfied with the work we have done and are excited about the future of this tool. To all that we have told you, we add an invitation to collaborate on open source or open science projects and, if you have already done so, we encourage you to continue to do so. We were often motivated by seeing our PRs being approved, we shared feelings of achievement and new challenges and, most importantly, we were applying what open source promotes: small collaborations make big changes and add to the projects, achieving good and useful results. After all this, you may wonder about the barriers to collaboration. We dedicate the following lines to describe what we rescued from our experience. Can you find barriers to collaboration? # The progress of your contributions depends on you. It is vital to ask questions and not get bogged down by doubts. Often there is someone who can show you that the problem you thought was big was simply a small one, perhaps the code didn't work because it was single quotes instead of double quotes, for example. From the OSL community we can highlight that it focuses on creating friendly, opportunity-filled spaces where you can share and acquire new knowledge, eliminating barriers and discrimination. Perhaps you can find these same characteristics in other open science and/or open source projects. That's why we want to invite you again to support and join the diverse Python and open source community. It's an excellent experience and the fact of contributing to something that can be useful to other people is quite satisfying. In general, collaborating on open source projects is a great way to improve your programming skills, you also have the opportunity to work with other developers and learn from them, get feedback on your work. If you want to support or boost your project, the first thing to do is to get started. Many communities are open to new contributions and innovative ideas.

We are also grateful for the support of the PSF, which has allowed us to make a contribution to SciCookie. We feel satisfied with the work we have done and are excited about the future of this tool. To all that we have told you, we add an invitation to collaborate on open source or open science projects and, if you have already done so, we encourage you to continue to do so. We were often motivated by seeing our PRs being approved, we shared feelings of achievement and new challenges and, most importantly, we were applying what open source promotes: small collaborations make big changes and add to the projects, achieving good and useful results. After all this, you may wonder about the barriers to collaboration. We dedicate the following lines to describe what we rescued from our experience.","title":"How was our learning process?"},{"location":"blog/psf-funding-open-source-projects-development-scicookie/index-en/#can-you-find-barriers-to-collaboration","text":"The progress of your contributions depends on you. It is vital to ask questions and not get bogged down by doubts. Often there is someone who can show you that the problem you thought was big was simply a small one, perhaps the code didn't work because it was single quotes instead of double quotes, for example. From the OSL community we can highlight that it focuses on creating friendly, opportunity-filled spaces where you can share and acquire new knowledge, eliminating barriers and discrimination. Perhaps you can find these same characteristics in other open science and/or open source projects. That's why we want to invite you again to support and join the diverse Python and open source community. It's an excellent experience and the fact of contributing to something that can be useful to other people is quite satisfying. In general, collaborating on open source projects is a great way to improve your programming skills, you also have the opportunity to work with other developers and learn from them, get feedback on your work. If you want to support or boost your project, the first thing to do is to get started. Many communities are open to new contributions and innovative ideas. Leave us your comments if you want to know more about what we have told you in this space :D [1] Additional note : SciCookie originally went by the name of cookiecutter-python and then renamed to osl-python-template.

To effectively test and train these models with large datasets, scaling becomes a significant challenge, particularly in connecting Python analysts to distributed hardware. This challenge is particularly pronounced in the realm of data science and machine learning workloads. The complexities in this process often result in discrepancies that can lead to flawed training of data and consequently, inaccurate results. In this blog, we will suggest an effective solution to address the challenges discussed above. Imagine how much easier the scaling process would be with a Python library that could perform on both parallel and distributed computing. This is precisely what Dask does! What is Dask? # Dask is an open-source, parallel and distributed computing library in Python that facilitates efficient and scalable processing of large datasets. It is designed to seamlessly integrate with existing Python libraries and tools, providing a familiar interface for users already comfortable with Python and its libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Jupyter, Scikit-Learn, and others but want to scale those workloads across a cluster. Dask is particularly useful for working with larger-than-memory datasets, parallelizing computations, and handling distributed computing. Setting Up Dask # Installing Dask is straightforward and can be done using Conda or Pip. For Anaconda users, Dask comes pre-installed, highlighting its popularity in the data science community. Alternatively, you can install Dask via Pip, ensuring to include the complete extension to install all required dependencies automatically. #install using conda conda install dask #install using conda ! pip install \"dask[complete]\" - q Basic Concepts of Dask # At its core, Dask extends the capabilities of traditional tools like pandas, NumPy, and Spark to handle larger-than-memory datasets. It achieves this by breaking large objects like arrays and dataframes into smaller, manageable chunks or partitions. This approach allows Dask to distribute computations efficiently across all available cores on your machine. Dask DataFrames # One of the standout features of Dask is its ability to handle large datasets effortlessly. With Dask DataFrames, you can seamlessly work with datasets exceeding 1 GB in size. By breaking the dataset into smaller chunks, Dask ensures efficient processing while maintaining the familiar interface of pandas DataFrames. Features of Dask: # Parallel and Distributed Computing: Dask enables parallel and distributed computing, making it a go-to solution for handling datasets that exceed the available memory of a single machine. It breaks down computations into smaller tasks, allowing for concurrent execution and optimal resource utilization. #demonstrating parallel and distributed computing using Dask import dask.array as da # Create a large random array x = da . random . random (( 10000 , 10000 ), chunks = ( 1000 , 1000 )) # 10,000 x 10,000 array # Perform element-wise computation y = x * 2 # Compute the sum along one axis z = y . sum ( axis = 0 ) # Compute the result in parallel across multiple cores or distributed across a cluster result = z . compute () print ( result ) OUTPUT [ 9986.14978723 10073.19700192 9985.6576724 ... 9923.550924 9978.70237439 9990.8504103 ] Dask Collections: Dask provides high-level abstractions known as Dask collections, which are parallel and distributed counterparts to familiar Python data structures. These include dask.array for parallel arrays, dask.bag for parallel bags, and dask.dataframe for parallel dataframes, seamlessly integrating with existing Python libraries. #Using dask collections import dask.array as da # Creating a dummy dataset using Dask x = da . ones (( 100 , 100 ), chunks = ( 10 , 10 )) # Creating a 100x100 array of ones with chunks of 10x10 y = x + x . T # Adding the transpose of x to itself result = y . mean () # Calculating the mean of y # Computing the result print ( result . compute ()) # Outputting the computed result OUTPUT 2.0 Lazy Evaluation: One of Dask's core principles is lazy evaluation. Instead of immediately computing results, Dask builds a task graph representing the computation. The actual computation occurs only when the results are explicitly requested. This approach enhances efficiency and allows for optimizations in resource usage. #Lazy Evalution with dask import dask.dataframe as dd import numpy as np import pandas as pd # Creating a dummy dataset num_rows = 100 # Number of rows data = { 'column' : np . random . randint ( 0 , 100 , size = num_rows ), 'value' : np . random . rand ( num_rows ) } # Creating a Pandas DataFrame df_pandas = pd . DataFrame ( data ) # Saving the Pandas DataFrame to a CSV file df_pandas . to_csv ( 'your_dataset.csv' , index = False ) # Reading the CSV file into a Dask DataFrame df = dd . read_csv ( 'your_dataset.csv' ) # Filtering the Dask DataFrame filtered_df = df [ df [ 'column' ] > 10 ] # Calculating the mean of the filtered DataFrame mean_result = filtered_df [ 'value' ] . mean () # No computation happens until explicitly requested print ( mean_result . compute ()) # Outputting the computed result OUTPUT 0.5112260135512784 Integration with Existing Libraries: Dask is designed to integrate seamlessly with popular Python libraries, such as NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn. This means that you can often replace existing code with Dask equivalents without significant modifications. # Integration with NumPy import dask.array as da import numpy as np # Generating a random NumPy array x_np = np . random . random (( 100 , 100 )) # Converting the NumPy array to a Dask array x_dask = da . from_array ( x_np , chunks = ( 10 , 10 )) # Performing operations on the Dask array y_dask = x_dask + x_dask . T # Computing the result print ( y_dask . compute ()) OUTPUT [[1.40940907 1.32044698 1.48172367 ... 1.4266846 0.84142743 0.33577001] [1.32044698 1.02252065 1.17250384 ... 0.40216939 1.58544767 1.12049071] [1.48172367 1.17250384 1.98886224 ... 0.86271956 1.27977778 0.95136532] ...

This makes it well-suited for handling larger-than-memory datasets efficiently. Dask is a powerful tool for data scientists and engineers working with large-scale data processing tasks, providing a convenient way to scale computations without requiring a complete rewrite of existing code. # Dynamic task scheduling with Dask import dask @dask . delayed def square ( x ): return x * x data = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ] results = [] for value in data : result = square ( value ) results . append ( result ) final_result = dask . compute ( * results ) print ( final_result ) OUTPUT (1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81) Conclusion: # Dask stands as a powerful tool in the Python ecosystem, addressing the challenges posed by the ever-increasing scale of data. Its ability to seamlessly integrate with existing libraries, support lazy evaluation, and provide parallel and distributed computing makes it a valuable asset for data scientists and engineers tackling large-scale data processing tasks.

The Big Lesson # GSoC isn't just about code\u2014it's about mentoring. Code is the artifact; mentoring is the engine. The best summers happen when we design for learning, clarity, and care. Everything else follows. Recommendations for Organizers # Confirm your slot count early.

The pre-selection phase is intense. If you're stretched across multiple proposals, candidates won't get the guidance they deserve. One well-mentored project beats three under-mentored ones. Codify contribution rules up front. Document expectations clearly and link them everywhere: Max PR size (e.g., \u201cprefer \u2264300 lines; split larger changes\u201d). Stale PR policy (e.g., \u201cno updates for 10 days \u2192 close or draft\u201d). Code style, linting, and formatting rules. Clear stance on AI-generated code (allowed or not, and under what conditions). Keep your CONTRIBUTING.md and PR template current. Treat them as living documents.

Built on top of the well-known Click library, Typer leverages Python 3.6+ features, like type hints, to define CLI commands in a straightforward and intuitive way. Why Choose Typer? # Simplicity : With Typer, you can create powerful CLI applications using minimal code. Type Hints : Leverages Python's type hints for parameter declaration, reducing errors and improving code clarity. Automatic Help : Generates help text and error messages based on your code. Subcommands : Supports nested commands, allowing complex CLI applications. Getting Started with Typer # Installation # To begin using Typer, you first need to install it. You can easily do this using pip: ! pip install typer - q Creating Your First Typer Application # Let's start with a simple example. We'll create an application that greets a user. First, import Typer and create an instance of it: import typer app = typer . Typer () Now, define a function that will act as your command. Use type hints for function arguments: @app . command () def greet ( name : str = typer . Option ( \"--name\" , \"-n\" , help = \"The name of the person to greet.\" ) ) -> None : \"\"\"Greets the user by name.\"\"\" typer . echo ( f \"Hello { name } !\" ) To run this application, use the following code block at the end of your script: if __name__ == \"__main__\" : app () Running the Application # Save the script as greet.py and run it from the command line: %% writefile greet . py import typer app = typer . Typer () @app . command () def greet ( name : str = typer . Option ( ... , \"--name\" , help = \"The name of the person to greet.\" ) ) -> None : \"\"\"Greets the user by name.\"\"\" typer . echo ( f \"Hello { name } !\" ) if __name__ == \"__main__\" : app () OUTPUT Overwriting greet.py ! python greet . py -- name Alice OUTPUT Hello Alice! Help Documentation # Typer automatically generates help documentation for your application. Try running: ! python greet . py -- help OUTPUT Usage: greet.py [OPTIONS] Greets the user by name. Options: --name TEXT The name of the person to greet. [required] --install-completion [bash|zsh|fish|powershell|pwsh] Install completion for the specified shell. --show-completion [bash|zsh|fish|powershell|pwsh] Show completion for the specified shell, to copy it or customize the installation. --help Show this message and exit. You'll get a detailed description of how to use the command, including available options. Working with Subcommands # Typer supports subcommands, allowing you to build more complex applications. In the following example, the script is structured around a main Typer application (app) and two sub-applications (app_user and app_product). This hierarchical structure is a hallmark of Typer, allowing for the organization of commands into distinct categories \u2013 in this case, user-related and product-related operations. Such an approach not only enhances the readability and maintainability of the code but also provides a more intuitive interface for the end users. They can easily navigate through the different functionalities of the application, whether it's creating or updating users, or handling product information. %% writefile ecommerce . py import typer from typer import Context , Option app = typer . Typer ( help = \"Operations for e-commerce.\" ) app_user = typer . Typer ( help = \"Operations for user model.\" ) app_product = typer .

Argument ( ... , help = \"Name of the product to update.\" )) -> None : \"\"\"Update a product with the given name.\"\"\" print ( f \"Updating product: { name } - Done\" ) if __name__ == \"__main__\" : app () OUTPUT Overwriting ecommerce.py A key feature demonstrated in the script is the use of the callback function with the invoke_without_command=True parameter. This setup enables the execution of specific code (like displaying the version or help text) before any subcommands are processed. It's a powerful tool for handling pre-command logic or global options that apply to the entire CLI application. Moreover, the script showcases the simplicity and elegance of defining commands in Typer. Each operation, such as creating or updating users and products, is defined as a function, with parameters automatically translated into command-line options or arguments. This approach not only makes the code more readable but also leverages Python's type hints to ensure that the command-line arguments are correctly interpreted, providing a seamless and error-free user experience. In the following lines, there are some examples of the CLI call with different parameters. ! python ecommerce . py -- help OUTPUT Usage: ecommerce.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]... Operations for e-commerce. Options: -v, --version Show the version and exit. --install-completion [bash|zsh|fish|powershell|pwsh] Install completion for the specified shell. --show-completion [bash|zsh|fish|powershell|pwsh] Show completion for the specified shell, to copy it or customize the installation. --help Show this message and exit. Commands: product Operations for product model. user Operations for user model. ! python ecommerce . py -- version OUTPUT Version: 0.1.0 ! python ecommerce . py user -- help OUTPUT Usage: ecommerce.py user [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

[required] Options: --help Show this message and exit. ! python ecommerce . py product -- help Conclusion # Typer is a powerful yet straightforward tool for building CLI applications in Python. By leveraging Python's type hints, it offers an intuitive way to define commands and parameters, automatically handles help documentation, and supports complex command structures with subcommands.

One such paradigm is multiple dispatch (or multimethods), which allows functions to behave differently based on the type of their arguments. While not natively supported in Python, this feature can be incredibly powerful, particularly in complex applications such as mathematical computations, data processing, or when working with abstract syntax trees (ASTs). This is where plum-dispatch comes into play. What is Multiple Dispatch? # Multiple dispatch is a feature where the function to be executed is determined by the types of multiple arguments. This is different from single dispatch (which Python supports natively via the functools.singledispatch decorator), where the function called depends only on the type of the first argument. Introducing Plum-Dispatch # plum-dispatch is a Python library that provides an efficient and easy-to-use implementation of multiple dispatch. It allows you to define multiple versions of a function, each tailored to different types of input arguments. Installation # First things first, let's install plum-dispatch : ! pip install plum - dispatch - q Basic Usage # To demonstrate the basic usage of plum-dispatch , let's start with a simple example. Suppose we have a function that needs to behave differently when passed an integer versus when it's passed a string. from plum import dispatch class Processor : @dispatch def process ( self , data : int ): return f \"Processing integer: { data } \" @dispatch def process ( self , data : str ): return f \"Processing string: { data } \" In this example, Processor has two process methods, one for integers and one for strings. plum-dispatch takes care of determining which method to call based on the type of data . Advanced Example: Working with ASTs # plum-dispatch shines in more complex scenarios, such as when working with different types of nodes in an abstract syntax tree. Let's create a simple AST representation with different node types and a visitor class to process these nodes. class StringNode : def __init__ ( self , value ): self . value = value class NumberNode : def __init__ ( self , value ): self . value = value class BaseASTVisitor : @dispatch def visit ( self , node : StringNode ): raise Exception ( \"Not implemented yet.\" ) @dispatch def visit ( self , node : NumberNode ): raise Exception ( \"Not implemented yet.\" ) class ASTVisitor ( BaseASTVisitor ): @dispatch def visit ( self , node : StringNode ): return f \"Visited StringNode with value: { node . value } \" @dispatch def visit ( self , node : NumberNode ): return f \"Visited NumberNode with value: { node . value } \" With plum-dispatch , our ASTVisitor can have a single visit method that behaves differently depending on whether it's visiting a StringNode or a NumberNode . Putting It All Together # Now, let's see plum-dispatch in action: processor = Processor () print ( processor . process ( 123 )) # \"Processing integer: 123\" print ( processor . process ( \"abc\" )) # \"Processing string: abc\" visitor = ASTVisitor () print ( visitor . visit ( StringNode ( \"Hello\" ))) # \"Visited StringNode with value: Hello\" print ( visitor . visit ( NumberNode ( 456 ))) # \"Visited NumberNode with value: 456\" OUTPUT Processing integer: 123 Processing string: abc Visited StringNode with value: Hello Visited NumberNode with value: 456 Conclusion # plum-dispatch offers a neat and powerful way to implement multiple dispatch in Python, making your code more modular, readable, and elegant. Whether you're dealing with simple data types or complex structures like ASTs, plum-dispatch can help you write more efficient and maintainable code.

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use boolean.py , a Python library, for handling Boolean expressions. We'll apply it to medical symptom data as an illustrative example. Introduction to boolean.py # boolean.py is a Python library for creating, manipulating, and evaluating Boolean expressions. It's particularly useful in scenarios where you need to parse and evaluate expressions that represent conditions or filters, such as searching for specific symptoms in a medical database. Installation # First and foremost, you need to have boolean.py installed in your Python environment. You can easily install it using pip. Run the following command: ! pip install - q boolean . py Basic Usage # We begin with basic Boolean operations, which are the foundation of working with this library. Creating Boolean Variables # import boolean from boolean.boolean import BooleanAlgebra # Create a Boolean algebra system algebra = BooleanAlgebra () # Define some symptoms as variables fever = algebra . Symbol ( 'fever' ) cough = algebra . Symbol ( 'cough' ) fever , cough OUTPUT (Symbol('fever'), Symbol('cough')) In this code, we import BooleanAlgebra from boolean.py and create an instance of it. We then define Boolean variables (symbols) for common symptoms. These symbols act as the basic units for our Boolean expressions. Basic Boolean Operations # # AND operation symptoms_and = fever & cough print ( symptoms_and ) # OR operation symptoms_or = fever | cough print ( symptoms_or ) # NOT operation no_fever = ~ fever print ( no_fever ) OUTPUT fever&cough fever|cough ~fever Here, we demonstrate basic Boolean operations: AND, OR, and NOT. These operations are essential in constructing more complex Boolean expressions. For example, symptoms_and represents a scenario where a patient has both fever and cough. Advanced Expressions # Now, let's create more complex expressions that could simulate queries for medical symptoms. Complex Expressions # headache = algebra . Symbol ( 'headache' ) fatigue = algebra . Symbol ( 'fatigue' ) # Complex expression complex_symptoms = ( fever | cough ) & ~ headache & fatigue print ( complex_symptoms ) OUTPUT ((fever|cough)&~headache)&fatigue This complex expression can represent a more specific medical query. For instance, it could be used to find patients who have either fever or cough, do not have a headache, but are experiencing fatigue. Evaluating Expressions # We can evaluate these expressions with specific values to simulate checking a patient's symptoms against our criteria. # Define truthy and falsy symbols true = algebra . TRUE false = algebra . FALSE # Define complex expression complex_symptoms = ( fever | cough ) & ~ headache & fatigue # Define a patient's symptoms using truthy and falsy symbols patient_symptoms = { fever : true , cough : false , headache : false , fatigue : true } # Substitute symbols in the expression with the corresponding patient symptoms substituted_expression = complex_symptoms . subs ( patient_symptoms ) # Evaluate the expression # The expression itself is the result since boolean.py does not evaluate to Python booleans result = substituted_expression print ( \"Does the patient match the criteria?\" , result , \"=\" , result . simplify () == true ) OUTPUT Does the patient match the criteria? (((1)|(0))&(~(0)))&(1) = True In this example, we demonstrate how to evaluate a Boolean expression against a set of patient symptoms. We use .subs() to replace each symbol in our expression with the corresponding value (symptom presence) from patient_symptoms . The .simplify() method then evaluates this substituted expression to a Boolean value, indicating whether the patient's symptoms match our query criteria. Parsing Expressions from Strings # Lastly, we explore parsing Boolean expressions from strings, a powerful feature for dynamic expression construction. Parsing Example # expression_string = \"(fever | cough) & ~headache & fatigue\" # Parse the expression from string parsed_expression = algebra . parse ( expression_string ) # Display the parsed expression print ( \"parsed expression:\" , parsed_expression ) # Evaluate with the same patient symptoms result = parsed_expression . subs ( patient_symptoms ) print ( f \"Does the patient match the criteria? { result . simplify () == true } \" ) OUTPUT parsed expression: (fever|cough)&~headache&fatigue Does the patient match the criteria? True Parsing expressions from strings is extremely useful when you need to construct Boolean expressions dynamically, such as from user inputs or configuration files. In this example, we parse a string representing a Boolean expression and then evaluate it as before. expression_string = '(fever | \"blood cough\") & ~headache & fatigue' # Parse the expression from string try : parsed_expression = algebra . parse ( expression_string ) except boolean . ParseError as e : print ( \"[EE]\" , str ( e )) OUTPUT [EE] Unknown token for token: \"\"\" at position: 9 The string parser doesn't work with complex strings directly, but creating a manual symbol for the disease works fine. blood_cough = boolean . Symbol ( \"blood cough\" ) chest_infection = blood_cough & fever print ( \"=\" * 80 ) print ( \"patient without fever\" ) chest_infection_patient_symptoms = { blood_cough : true , fever : false } result = chest_infection . subs ( chest_infection_patient_symptoms ) print ( f \"Does the patient match the criteria? { result . simplify () == true } \" ) print ( \"=\" * 80 ) print ( \"patient with all symptoms\" ) chest_infection_patient_symptoms = { blood_cough : true , fever : true } result = chest_infection . subs ( chest_infection_patient_symptoms ) print ( f \"Does the patient match the criteria? { result . simplify () == true } \" ) OUTPUT ================================================================================ patient without fever Does the patient match the criteria? False ================================================================================ patient with all symptoms Does the patient match the criteria? True Conclusion # Throughout this tutorial, we have explored how to use boolean.py for handling and evaluating Boolean expressions in Python. By starting from basic operations and moving to parsing expressions from strings, we've covered a range of functionalities provided by this library. While we focused on a medical context, the principles and methods are broadly applicable across different domains.","title":"Working with Boolean Expressions in Python"},{"location":"blog/working-with-boolean-expressions-in-python/#working-with-boolean-expressions-in-python","text":"Boolean logic is a crucial component in many programming tasks, especially in searching and querying data.

Each project may have its own specific set of recommendations and rules; contributors should review those for each project. Community Engagement # Communication Platforms: Each project may use its preferred communication platform for discussions, such as code repository platforms (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) or chat-based platforms (Discord, Slack, etc.). Contributors should verify with the community and mentors which platform is recommended for seeking assistance, discussing ideas, and requesting reviews. Collaboration and Support: Contributors are encouraged to assist others when possible, as everyone is here to learn and support one another. Respect and Inclusivity: Contributors should communicate with kindness and respect, particularly when interacting with beginners or colleagues for whom English may not be their first language. Instead of engaging in arguments, they should offer constructive feedback and encouragement to help others improve both their language and technical skills. Channel Usage: If the primary discussion channel is not the code repository platform, contributors should use the designated platform to draw attention to pull requests or issues. Initiating a discussion there prior to opening issues or pull requests is also expected. Contributions # Task Coordination: Contributors should avoid duplicating work by verifying whether someone else is already addressing a task or if the task remains relevant before beginning work. Managing Stale Contributions: Project maintainers may implement mechanisms to label and close stale issues and pull requests. Some contributors open pull requests without following up or addressing review recommendations, which can impede progress. Branch Management: When updating a branch, contributors should follow the project's preferred approach, whether that involves using a rebase or a merge commit . If your PR is not ready yet for review, please keep it in draft mode . Coding Tips # Ensure that pre-commit is applied to your branch before opening a pull request. Run pre-commit install to enable pre-commit hooks, ensuring they are applied automatically before every commit. Avoid excessive nesting. Try to keep nesting levels to four or fewer for better readability and maintainability. Follow the project's specific coding guidelines. Review them regularly to ensure consistency across contributions. Remove any unnecessary comments. In most cases, if you need to explain what your code does, it may indicate that the code is unclear or overly complex. This is also often a sign of code generated by Generative AI. Do not use emojis in comments. This is typically seen as a red flag and may suggest improper use of AI-generated content. Ensure there is an empty line at the end of each file. GitHub highlights missing end-of-file newlines with a red icon.
