professionals and peers dedicated to the advancement of open science and open
source. Whether you're considering applying to GSoC with Open Science Labs or if
you've already been accepted, this guide is designed to facilitate a smooth
transition into our collaborative environment. You'll find detailed instructions
on how to apply, connect with sub-organizations/projects, and make the most of
your GSoC period once you're on board. It's a chance to contribute to a global
movement and develop skills that will serve you throughout your career. Let's

how to make preliminary contributions that will set you apart.

### 1. How to Apply

#### 1.1. Choosing a Sub-Organization/Project

Begin by exploring the list of available sub-organizations under the Open
Science Labs organization and their projects. Look for one that aligns with your
interests and skills.

#### 1.2. Initiating Contact with Projects and Mentors

feedback will be provided, allowing candidates to shift to another project if
necessary to ensure a suitable fit.

## Part II: Approved Contributors

This part of the guide will serve as a roadmap to your success in the GSoC with
Open Science Labs. It outlines the expectations for your collaboration with
mentors, the importance of communication, and the coding standards you should
follow. You will find tips on how to maintain an effective workflow, stay
proactive, and ensure that your contribution leaves a lasting impact.

### Effective Workflow and Proactivity

Once accepted, establish a regular workflow with your mentor. Be proactive: seek
out tasks, ask questions, and push beyond the basics. Set up frequent check-ins
and be clear about what you aim to accomplish each week.

progress, challenges, and any assistance you may require. Use the communication
tools preferred by the project for all discussions.

### Programming Best Practices

Adhere to the programming standards and best practices recommended by your
mentor and the project. Write clean, well-documented, and maintainable code. Be
open to code reviews and feedback, as they are learning opportunities.

By following these guidelines, both candidates and approved contributors can
maximize their growth, contributions, and overall experience within the GSoC
with Open Science Labs.
