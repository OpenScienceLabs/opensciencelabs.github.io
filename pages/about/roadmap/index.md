# Open Science Labs Roadmap - 2025

## Introduction

As Open Science Labs continues to evolve, our focus shifts towards more
structured and impactful initiatives. This roadmap outlines our strategic plan,
highlighting new areas of development while maintaining our commitment to the
open science and technology community.

## Initiatives and Objectives

### Collaborative Research Initiative

- **Objective:** Establish a collaborative research network with an initial
  focus on data science. This will serve as a hub for innovation, research, and
  development in cutting-edge data science methodologies.
- **Plan:**
  - Identify key areas within data science for initial research projects, seek
    partnerships with industry experts, and secure funding for research
    activities.

### Educational Partnerships for Complementary Support

- **Objective:** Partner with educational institutions to provide students and
  alumni with supplementary support aimed at enhancing their programming skills
  and familiarity with open technological tools.
- **Plan:**
  - Open Science Labs will keep leveraging its Discord server to offer a
    supportive community where students and alumni can enhance their
    professional skills. Additionally, we offer internships involving real-world
    projects that not only help participants gain practical experience but also
    contribute to open projects impacting a wide user base.

### Participation in Google Summer of Code

- **Objective:** Apply to become a mentoring organization in Google Summer of
  Code.
- **Plan:**
  - Prepare a compelling application showcasing OSLâ€™s commitment to mentoring
    and contribution to open source, and outline potential projects and mentor
    profiles.

### OSL Grants Program

- **Objective:** To provide financial support to affiliated and incubated
  projects.
- **Historical Records:**
  - In 2024, OSL allocated funds to support the development of the SciCookie
    project.
- **Plan:**
  - Establish transparent criteria and a robust selection process for grant
    allocation.
  - Secure additional funding and manage the distribution of grants to foster
    innovation within the OSL community.

### Open Source Internship Program

- **Objective:** Refine and expand the internship program based on insights
  gained from previous iterations.
- **Plans:**
  - Broaden the participation by increasing the number of projects that are
    affiliated or incubated within the program.
  - Enhance communication strategies to effectively engage and attract more
    potential candidates.

### Study Group

- **Description:** Open to all who wish to sharpen their problem-solving skills,
  the study group currently tackles the Advent of Code 2025 challenges,
  providing a focused arena for technical development.
- **Objective:** To expand community participation, thereby enriching the
  learning environment through exposure to diverse perspectives and
  problem-solving approaches.
- **Plans:**
  - To intensify outreach efforts aimed at attracting a wider audience and
    boosting participation rates.

## Conclusion

This roadmap represents OSL's commitment to advancing open science and open
source communities through research, education, and collaborative efforts.
