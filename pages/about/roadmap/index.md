# Open Science Labs Roadmap - 2024

## Introduction

As Open Science Labs continues to evolve, our focus shifts towards more
structured and impactful initiatives. This roadmap outlines our strategic plan,
highlighting new areas of development while maintaining our commitment to the
open science and technology community.

## New Initiatives and Objectives

### Research Center

- **Objective:** Establish a research center with an initial focus on data
  science. This will serve as a hub for innovation, research, and development in
  cutting-edge data science methodologies.
- **Plan:** Identify key areas within data science for initial research
  projects, seek partnerships with industry experts, and secure funding for
  research activities.

### Educational Partnerships for Skill Enhancement

- **Objective:** Collaborate with educational institutions to offer
  complementary programs aimed at enhancing student skills in programming and
  technological tools.
- **Plan:** Develop curriculum modules that are meticulously designed to
  integrate seamlessly with existing courses, with a strong emphasis on
  practical applications in both research and software development. We aim to
  establish strategic partnerships to effectively administer this program,
  ensuring that participants enjoy an exceptional experience enriched with
  cutting-edge content. Additionally, this initiative opens up opportunities for
  co-creating new content alongside our partners, community members, and
  affiliates, fostering a collaborative and innovative learning environment.

### Participation in Google Summer of Code

- **Objective:** Apply to become a mentoring organization in Google Summer of
  Code.
- **Plan:** Prepare a compelling application showcasing OSLâ€™s commitment to
  mentoring and contribution to open source, and outline potential projects and
  mentor profiles.

### Online Workshops for Technological Tools

- **Objective:** Offer a series of online workshops to the community, focusing
  on important technological tools relevant to research and development.
- **Plan:** Identify key tools and technologies for the workshops, recruit
  expert facilitators, and organize a schedule that accommodates a global
  audience.

### Project Affiliation Program

- **New Initiative:** Launch the Project Affiliation program to bring external
  projects under the OSL umbrella, offering various benefits.
- **Implementation Plan:**
    - Identify and invite potential projects to join the OSL ecosystem.
    - Provide affiliated projects with opportunities to participate in the OSL
      Internship and Grants Programs.
    - Work towards extending additional support and resources as the program
      matures.

### OSL Grants Program

- **New Initiative:** Establish the OSL Grants Program to offer financial
  support to affiliated projects.
- **Implementation Plan:**
    - Develop criteria and a selection process for grant allocation.
    - Secure funding and manage the distribution of grants to support innovative
      projects and initiatives within the OSL community.

## Continuing Initiatives

### Internship Program for Open Source Projects

- **Current Status:** Successfully running our second cycle, modeled after
  Google Summer of Code, providing hands-on experience in open source projects.
- **Objective:** Continuously enhance the internship program based on learned
  experiences, aiming to offer an enriching and educational journey for interns.
- **Plan for Improvement:**
    - Analyze feedback from previous cycles to identify areas for enhancement in
      both the program structure and mentorship experience.
    - Refine project criteria and the intern selection process to align with
      evolving industry standards and educational goals.
    - Strengthen the support system for interns, ensuring an environment that
      fosters both learning and meaningful contributions to open source projects.
    - Implement new strategies and tools to streamline communication, project
      tracking, and collaborative learning.

### Events and Community Engagement

- Continue encouraging community-organized events on open science and
  technologies.
- Plan an annual conference covering a wide range of topics in open science and
  technology.

### Strengthening Partnerships

- Expand the partnership program to include more diverse projects and groups.
- Enhance the framework for partnership, focusing on mutual growth and
  opportunity sharing.

### Study Groups

- **Current Status:** Running a study group in partnership with LiteRev,
  focusing on the Udacity course CS212: Design of Computer Programs.
- **Future Plans:** Continue organizing study groups on various topics to
  facilitate collaborative learning and skill development within the community.
