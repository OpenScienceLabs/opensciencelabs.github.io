Open Science Labs has been awarded a grant from the Python Software Foundation
[(PSF)](https://www.python.org/psf-landing/) in April 2023 to improve a Python
project template (for cookiecutter or cookieninja) that implements all (as far
as possible) the best practices recommended by pyOpenSci, but is not limited to
them. It offers all current best practice approaches and tools as options,
including CI, documentation, static static analysis tools, etc. Thanks to the
grant, dependencies will be and some configuration changes.
