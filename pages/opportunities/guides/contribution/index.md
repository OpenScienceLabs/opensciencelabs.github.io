# Contribution Guidelines

These recommendations are general guidelines from Open Science Labs. Each
project may have its own specific set of recommendations and rules; contributors
should review those for each project.

## Community Engagement

- **Communication Platforms:** Each project may use its preferred communication
  platform for discussions, such as code repository platforms (GitHub, GitLab,
  etc.) or chat-based platforms (Discord, Slack, etc.). Contributors should
  verify with the community and mentors which platform is recommended for
  seeking assistance, discussing ideas, and requesting reviews.

- **Collaboration and Support:** Contributors are encouraged to assist others
  when possible, as everyone is here to learn and support one another.

- **Respect and Inclusivity:** Contributors should communicate with kindness and
  respect, particularly when interacting with beginners or colleagues for whom
  English may not be their first language. Instead of engaging in arguments,
  they should offer constructive feedback and encouragement to help others
  improve both their language and technical skills.

- **Channel Usage:** If the primary discussion channel is not the code
  repository platform, contributors should use the designated platform to draw
  attention to pull requests or issues. Initiating a discussion there prior to
  opening issues or pull requests is also expected.

## Contributions

- **Task Coordination:** Contributors should avoid duplicating work by verifying
  whether someone else is already addressing a task or if the task remains
  relevant before beginning work.

- **Managing Stale Contributions:** Project maintainers may implement mechanisms
  to label and close stale issues and pull requests. Some contributors open pull
  requests without following up or addressing review recommendations, which can
  impede progress.

- **Code Quality:** Contributors must ensure that `pre-commit` is applied in
  their branch before opening a pull request. Additionally, they should adhere
  to coding best practices, such as avoiding excessive nesting blocks, following
  SOLID principles, and refraining from assigning different types to the same
  variable. It is important to consult the project's specific coding guidelines
  for additional best practices.

- **Branch Management:** When updating a branch, contributors should follow the
  project's preferred approach, whether that involves using a **rebase** or a
  **merge commit**.

- **Commenting Practices:** Excessive or unnecessary comments should be avoided,
  as well the use of emojis in comments, as they may suggest that the content
  was generated entirely by an AI.
