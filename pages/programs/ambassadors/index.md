# Open Science Labs (OSL) Ambassadors Program

knowledge and innovation. Our Ambassadors Program aims to spread this belief far

YouTube account, ensuring a professional and engaging online experience.

For in-person meetings, it's important to secure a welcoming venue and to
provide some snacks for participants. A comfortable environment enhances
interaction and learning.

In addition to regular meetings, we encourage organizing sprint sessions. These
intensive, collaborative efforts can focus on anything from code development to
whitepaper drafting, providing a deeper engagement with the community.
