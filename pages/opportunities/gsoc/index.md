# Google Summer of Code (GSoC) at Open Science Labs

Open Science Labs is excited to apply as a mentoring organization for Google
Summer of Code 2025. This global program is an excellent opportunity for
students and newcomers to dive into open source software development.

## About Google Summer of Code

Google Summer of Code offers students worldwide the chance to contribute to open
source projects over the summer. This initiative is not only about coding; it's
about learning the open source culture, understanding project maintenance, and
improving software alongside experienced mentors.

For more information about GSoC, check out its official web page at
<https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/>.

### Why Participate with OSL?

Open Science Labs has a history of participation under the NumFOCUS umbrella in
2023 and 2024, providing robust support to budding open-source enthusiasts
through structured projects that enhance both learning and contribution.

### Project Ideas Submission

Mentors play a crucial role at GSoC, providing guidance and expertise to help
shape the next generation of open source contributors. If you have a project
that could use enhancements or require tricky bug fixes, please propose your
ideas. We welcome initial drafts, and if accepted, there will be time to refine
these ideas further.

The current list of project ideas can be found
[here](/opportunities/gsoc/project-ideas).

If you are considering submitting your project idea to OSL, please send your
project by email to <team@opensciencelabs.org> by February 6. Check out our
