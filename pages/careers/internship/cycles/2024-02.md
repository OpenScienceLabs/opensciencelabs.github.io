# OSL Internship/Apprenticeship Program Cycle 2: II-2024

We are excited to kick off the second cycle of the Open Science Labs (OSL)
Internship/Apprenticeship Program for 2024! This program offers a unique
opportunity for individuals to join as mentors or as students/collaborators.

The Internship/Apprenticeship Program is a collaborative effort between
[Open Science Labs](https://opensciencelabs.org) and
[The GRAPH Network](https://thegraphnetwork.org), with The GRAPH Network
providing institutional support for the program.

Please note that this internship program is unpaid, meaning there is no
financial compensation for either interns or mentors. Our goal is to facilitate
collaboration on projects and provide students and contributors with valuable
experience in engaging with open source initiatives.

Below you'll find essential information about each role and how to get involved.

## Guidelines for Mentors

To submit a project, you need to be a core contributor or have approval from the
core members of the project. This step is crucial to ensure the success of your
project plan, as support from core members is essential.

In our internship, we refer to a computer program, library, or tool as a
**PROJECT**. The tasks proposed for a project will be known as **PLAN** or
**PROPOSAL PLAN** if it's still in the proposal stage.

You are invited to submit a list of ideas (proposal plans) for one or more
projects you are involved with.

### Project Requirements

The criteria for project proposals are:

- Must be open source.
- Must have a Code of Conduct.
- Should have a clear list of tasks for the intern.
- Requires at least one mentor for guidance.

This format is similar to that of Google Summer of Code.

Each **proposal plan** should clearly define the minimum requirements, such as
programming languages, libraries, and necessary concepts.

### How to Apply

We welcome applications from everyone! You can apply at
[OSL Internship Project Application](https://tinyurl.com/osl-internship-projects-2024-1).

A list of tasks/issues for each **proposal plan** can be organized as a GitHub
epic (an issue with a list of linked issues), a GitHub Milestone, a PDF link, or
similar formats (on GitLab, BitBucket, etc.).

You may propose one or more projects, each with one or more plans.

To get a clearer understanding of structuring a plan for your project, we
recommend reviewing our template available here:
[Project Plan Template](https://opensciencelabs.org/programs/internship/templates/projects-ideas/).

## Guidelines for Students/Collaborators

The Open Science Labs internship is open to all who are interested in
contributing to open source projects.

During the application process, applicants will be referred to as
**candidates**.

Below are the details on eligibility and application instructions.

### Requirements

The primary requirement for applicants is to be at least 18 years old.

Each project will have its own set of criteria that candidates must meet to be
considered for the role.

The minimum weekly commitment for the internship is 20 hours. However,
dedicating more time, if possible, can greatly enhance the experience, providing
deeper insights into the project and its underlying technologies.

The internship cycle typically spans three months. If needed, it may be
extended, subject to mutual agreement between the mentor and the
student/contributor.

### How to Apply

Starting April 22, 2024, the Open Science Labs team will release a list of
available projects. This list will be shared on
[OSL Discord](https://opensciencelabs.org/discord),
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/open-science-labs/), and
[X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/opensciencelabs).

Candidates should review the list of projects and contact the mentor(s) for the
project(s) they are interested in. Mentors will assess the candidate's
suitability based on the project's specific requirements and may assign initial
tasks to gauge the candidate's capabilities.

Once these initial tasks are completed satisfactorily, the mentor will recommend
the candidate to officially apply to the internship program. The application
results will be announced on February 14, 2024.

### Recommendations for Internship Program Candidates

Maximizing your chances in the Open Science Labs Internship Program begins with
careful preparation and engagement. Here's how you can get started:

#### Selecting and Engaging with Projects

- **Explore Project Options:** Review the complete list of proposed projects (to
  be announced) to find those that align with your interests and skills.
- **Contact Mentors:** Reach out to mentors of the projects you're interested
  in. While it's okay to explore a couple of projects, focusing on one or at
  most two allows for deeper engagement and learning.
- **Contribute to Projects:** Before applying, try to have a few contributions
  accepted and merged into the project. This demonstrates your commitment and
  capability. **Note:** If you feel that your initially selected project is not
  the right fit, it's okay to consider another project. However, remember to
  communicate this change to your current mentor and express your gratitude for
  their time and guidance. Open communication and courtesy go a long way in
  maintaining positive relationships within the OSL community.

#### Technical Preparation

- **Familiarize Yourself with Git:** Basic knowledge of Git is essential, as all
  collaboration will involve using this tool. Brush up on Git commands and
  workflows to ensure you're ready.
- **Join the OSL Discord:** Engage with the community by joining the Open
  Science Labs Discord server at
  [OSL Discord](https://opensciencelabs.org/discord). You can join specific
  groups through the #subs-groups channel. For any queries, the general channel
  is your go-to resource.
- **Participate in Study Groups:** Enhance your skills by joining study groups
  within the OSL community. These groups are a great way to sharpen your skills
  and can be found via the #subs-groups channel on Discord.

#### Focus Areas for Early Contributions

- **Start with Accessible Issues:** Good first issues to tackle include
  documentation updates, writing unit tests, and fixing small bugs. These
  contributions are valuable and can serve as a great starting point.

#### Application Process

- **Apply Once Ready:** After receiving approval from your mentor, proceed to
  apply for the internship program at the specified link (to be announced).

## How the Internship Works

### Communication Channels

- **Student/Contributor and Mentor:** Interaction should occur on the platform
  or channel specified by the mentor, such as Discord, Slack, GitHub, WhatsApp,
  email, etc.

- **Open Science Labs with Students/Contributors:** Official communication will
  be through [OSL Discord](https://opensciencelabs.org/discord) in a designated
  group/channel for the specific internship cycle.

- **Open Science Labs with Mentors:** Communication with mentors will be
  conducted via email.

### Recommendations for Approved Interns

Success in the Open Science Labs Internship Program goes beyond just completing
tasks. To make the most of this opportunity, we encourage you to adopt the
following best practices:

#### Be Proactive in Communication

- **Frequent Updates:** Keep your mentor informed about your progress,
  challenges, and successes. Aim to provide updates once a day or every two
  days. Proactive communication helps build a strong relationship with your
  mentor and keeps your project on track.
- **Use Appropriate Channels:** Avoid direct messages (DMs) for project-related
  discussions. Stick to the communication channels recommended by your mentor,
  such as specific project channels or group discussions.

#### Continuous Learning and Engagement

- **Study Project Technologies:** Familiarize yourself with the technologies and
  tools used in your project. Understanding these will boost your productivity
  and contribution quality.
- **Participate in Study Groups:** Joining an Open Science Labs study group can
  enhance your skills and provide additional community support.

#### Document and Reflect

- **Blog Posts:** Regularly write about your learning experiences on the Open
  Science Labs Blog. Sharing new knowledge not only helps you organize your
  thoughts but also creates a valuable record of your journey for future
  reference.

#### Seek Feedback

- **Regular Check-ins:** Don’t hesitate to ask your mentor for feedback. This
  ensures you are moving in the right direction and aligning with project goals.

#### Utilize Supportive Technologies

- **Leverage AI Tools:** Consider using technologies like ChatGPT to help
  analyze problems, explore alternative solutions, and improve your code. These
  tools can also assist in enhancing documentation and blog posts.

By following these guidelines, you’ll not only contribute effectively to your
project but also enrich your overall learning and professional growth during the
internship.

### Blogging Requirement

During the internship, students/collaborators are expected to write blog posts
detailing new features, bug fixes, or improvements made to the project. These
posts should be published on the [OSL Blog](https://opensciencelabs.org/blog/)
and can also be cross-posted to the project's blog.

### Evaluations

The internship includes two major evaluations:

- **Midterm Evaluation:** Mentors assess the progress of their
  students/collaborators.
