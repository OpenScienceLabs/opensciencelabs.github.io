# Open Science Labs (OSL) Incubator Program

Open Science Labs is committed to fostering the growth and development of
innovative scientific projects and/or software for support tasks like DevOps,
Automation, etc. Our Incubator Program is designed to provide structure and
support at various stages of development, helping projects grow from a mere idea
to a fully-fledged, sustainable project. The program is divided into three
distinct phases:

### 1. Proof of Concept (PoC)

**Description:** The PoC phase is the first step, aimed at experimenting with
new ideas and technologies to determine their feasibility and potential.
Projects in this phase can be found at
[OSL PoC GitHub Repository](https://github.com/osl-pocs).

**Criteria:**

- Preliminary design and concept.
- A clear vision of the problem the project aims to solve.
- Must be licensed under a license approved by Open Source Initiative (OSI).

**Application Process:**

- Submit a proposal through
  [OSL PoC GitHub Issues](https://github.com/osl-pocs/issues), including the
  concept, objectives, and a high-level design.
- Undergo a review process by the OSL selection committee.

### 2. Incubation

**Description:** This phase focuses on nurturing the project, providing
resources, mentorship, and facilitating access to grants and partners. Projects
in this stage can be found at
[OSL Incubator GitHub Repository](https://github.com/osl-incubator).

**Criteria:**

- Successful completion of the PoC phase.
- Clearly defined milestones and development plan.
- Strong community engagement and collaboration.
- Adherence to OSL’s guidelines, including licensing under an OSI-approved
  license.

**Ascending Process:**

- Complete the PoC phase with positive evaluations.
- Submit an application for the Incubation phase at
  [OSL Incubator GitHub Issues](https://github.com/osl-incubator/issues),
  including a detailed project plan.
- Obtain approval from OSL mentors and stakeholders.

**Support for Raising Funds:**

- OSL will assist in identifying suitable grants and partner organizations.
- Facilitate collaborations to support the project's financial needs.

### 3. Graduated

**Description:** The Graduated phase is the final step, indicating that the
project has matured and is ready for widespread adoption and sustainable growth.
Graduated projects are available at
[OSL Graduated GitHub Repository](https://github.com/osl-projects).

**Criteria:**

- Successful completion of the Incubation phase.
- Demonstrated stability, sustainability, and active community engagement.
- Ongoing adherence to OSL guidelines, including OSI-approved licensing.

**Ascending Process:**

- Successfully meet all the milestones during the Incubation phase.
- Submit a graduation application at
  [OSL Graduated GitHub Issues](https://github.com/osl-projects/issues),
  detailing achievements and future plans.
- Undergo a final review and approval by OSL’s governing board.

#### Peer review of scientific Python Projects via pyOpenSci

For all scientific Python projects under the Open Science Labs Incubator
program, the evaluation process will be conducted via
[pyOpenSci](https://www.pyopensci.org/), a community-led organization that
offers peer reviews of Python software to enhance its quality, usability, and
long-term maintainability. These peer reviews are pivotal in advancing the
open-source tools that underpin open science initiatives.

#### Benefits of Using pyOpenSci for Evaluation

1. **High-Quality Review**: pyOpenSci's review process focuses on ensuring that
   your Python package meets high standards in terms of code quality,
   documentation, and usability.

2. **JOSS Acceptance**: The Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) accepts a
   pyOpenSci review as their own. As such your project, if it is in scope for
   JOSS, can reap the benefits of both pyOpenSci and JOSS through a single peer
   review process.

3. **Community-Led**: Gain insights and recommendations from experts in the open
   science and Python communities.

##### Guidelines and Review Process

- **Project Guidelines**: All projects should follow pyOpenSci's packaging
  guidelines which can be accessed
  [here](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide/).

- **Peer Review Process**: The detailed guide for pyOpenSci's peer review
  process can be found
  [here](https://www.pyopensci.org/about-peer-review/index.html). We highly
  recommend going through this guide to understand what to expect during the
  review.

The pyOpenSci review process offers a valuable opportunity to enhance the
quality, usability, and maintainability of your software. Additionally, your
tool will gain increased visibility and community support once it is accepted
into the pyOpenSci ecosystem.

## Conclusion

The OSL Incubator Program is a robust pathway for innovative scientific projects
and projects for support tasks to grow and succeed. We invite all creators,
researchers, and enthusiasts to explore our program and become part of this
thriving ecosystem. Detailed information on applying for each phase, as well as
guidelines, can be found on our official website.
