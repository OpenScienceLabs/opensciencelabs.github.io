# OSL Project Ideas

Welcome to the Open Science Labs (OSL) project ideas page for the Open Source
Software Internship. As an umbrella organization, OSL hosts links to the ideas
pages of each member organization. You can explore these projects here.

At OSL, we've assembled a selection of project ideas that not only embody our
mission but also provide enriching experiences for student and newcomers
open-source developpers. These projects cover a variety of topics and
technologies, catering to diverse interests. Below, we've outlined some
potential project ideas we're considering for the internship. We believe these
projects provide students with a valuable chance to engage with open-source
efforts and develop their skills under the mentorship of seasoned professionals.

This page details the sub-organizations available for the internship
participants. Applicants are welcome to reach out to us on our
