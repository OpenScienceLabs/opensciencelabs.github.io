# SciCookie

## Project Idea 1: Improve Scicookie Documentation

### Abstract

The [documentation](https://osl-incubator.github.io/scicookie/intro.html) of
scicookie is incomplete and outdated for both the users and the developers of
the package. This project will aim to improve the documentation by adding
examples, creating landing page, adding API documentation, improving the
contributing guidelines, and improving the user and developer guide.

## Project Idea 2: Improve Scicookie experience using Cruft

### Abstract

Scicookie currently uses cookieninja as a template engine, but we are looking to
migrate it to [Cruft](https://cruft.github.io/cruft/). Cruft will allow updating
a project structure already created by scicookie. This project will also
investigate using multiple backends for templating, as
[scientific-python/cookie](https://github.com/scientific-python/cookie) does.
