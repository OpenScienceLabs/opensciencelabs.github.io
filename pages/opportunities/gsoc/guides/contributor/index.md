# Google Summer of Code (GSoC) Contributor Guide

This guide is intended for both prospective and accepted candidates of the GSoC
program with Open Science Labs. It provides detailed, objective instructions to
help navigate the application process, engage with mentors, and succeed during
the program period. The guide covers project selection, initial contributions,
proposal development, and expectations for approved contributors.

## Candidates' Guide

This section outlines the steps candidates should follow to apply effectively.

### How to Apply

#### Selecting a Sub-Organization/Project

Candidates should begin by reviewing the list of available sub-organizations
under Open Science Labs and their projects. It is important to choose a project
that aligns with individual interests and skills.

#### Initiating Contact with Projects and Mentors

Candidates are advised to contact project mentors using the recommended
communication platform (discord, slack, email, etc). A brief introduction,
expression of interest, and any initial questions about the project or mentoring
process should be included. Each project or sub-organizations should specify the
recommended platform for all the communications with candidates.

#### Making an Initial Contribution

Demonstrating commitment early on is valuable. Candidates are encouraged to
contribute a small but meaningful improvement—such as fixing a minor bug or
implementing small features suggested by the mentor.

#### Crafting a Proposal with Mentor Support

Under mentor guidance, candidates should develop a detailed proposal that
outlines:

- **Milestones and Timeline:** Specific tasks and expected outcomes within the
  program period.
- **Contribution Impact:** How the work will further the project’s goals.
- **Language and Style:** Clear, informative, and objective language; concise
  and focused content without unnecessary filler or marketing-style phrasing.

Candidates should also ensure that proposals do not exhibit signs of complete AI
generation, such as excessive buzzwords or generic phrasing. While AI tools may
be used to enhance clarity, the proposal must reflect the candidate’s own work.

It is essential to review the
[contributor rules](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules) for the program
and follow the proposal template provided
[here](/opportunities/gsoc/templates/contributor-proposal).

## Review Process

Mentors will evaluate proposals to determine if candidates meet the fundamental
requirements for effective contribution. Transparent feedback will be provided,
and candidates may be guided to consider alternative projects if a better fit is
identified. When a proposal is ready for review, candidates should send a direct
message to the mentors via the recommended communication channel (e.g., Discord,
Slack, or email). For all other communications, public channels are preferred.
Candidates should remain patient as mentors manage a high volume of messages,
issues, pull requests, and reviews.

## Approved Contributors

For accepted candidates, the following guidelines serve as a roadmap for
successful collaboration during the GSoC program with Open Science Labs.

### Effective Workflow and Proactivity

- **Establish a Regular Workflow:** Work closely with your mentor to set clear
  weekly objectives.
- **Proactive Engagement:** Actively seek tasks, ask clarifying questions, and
  schedule regular check-ins to monitor progress.

### Communication Best Practices

- **Timely Updates:** Keep mentors informed about progress, challenges, and any
  required assistance.
- **Use Designated Channels:** Communicate via the project’s preferred platforms
  to ensure transparency and prompt feedback.

### Programming Best Practices

- **Adherence to Standards:** Follow the coding standards and best practices
  outlined by your mentor and project guidelines.
- **Maintainable Code:** Write clean, well-documented, and maintainable code.
- **Constructive Feedback:** Embrace code reviews as opportunities to learn and
  improve your technical skills.
