## News: OSL receives PSF grant for its MAKIM and ASTx Projects

The Python Software Foundation (PSF) has agreed to fund two projects under the OSL umbrella. The projects are MAKIM and ASTx. Find out more about these projects and the ongoing PSF grant work in the following sections. 

## About the Python Software Foundation

The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is a nonprofit organisation dedicated to supporting the development of open-source projects linked to the Python language. Founded in March 2001, the PSF has grown to become an impactful and outstanding organisation sponsoring some of the most reputable Python-based open-source programs.

## MAKIM Improvements

Makim is a YAML-based task automation tool inspired by Make, offering structured definitions for tasks and dependencies with support for conditionals, arguments, grouping, variables, Jinja2 templating, and environment file integration. 

Our in-house team has made many recent updates to the project. A missing single quote was added to address an error related to a wrong command, enhancing command functionality. Support for interactive arguments was introduced, allowing for more dynamic user input. Dependency management was updated, specifically with the paginate library, while also resolving a CI installation issue to streamline the build process. Additionally, the attribute "shell" was refactored to "backend," improving code clarity. Finally, the configuration for MyPy was updated to ensure better type-checking practices.

## ASTx Improvements

ASTx is a language-agnostic expression structure designed primarily for the ArxLang project, although it can be utilised by any programming language or parser to create a high-level representation of Abstract Syntax Trees (AST). It does not function as a lexer or parser. Its features include modular AST blocks, control flow structures (like if/else statements and for loops), integer data types (Int8 to Int64), binary and unary operators, object visibility (public and private), scope management (global and local), a symbol table organised by scope, and function declarations and calls. 

Our team has made several developmental improvements to ASTx, which include the addition of a new import statement feature allowing for improved module management, implementation of runtime type checking using Typeguard, enhancement of type safety and reliability, and update on the Prettier configuration as well as the MAKIM and CI steps to streamline the development and integration processes.

## EXTRA: Sugar and SciCookie Both Have New Updates

MAKIM and ASTx are not the only projects getting new updates. The latest PRs on the Sugar repository have seen a fix for the Jinja2 template, another that refractors the interface for plugins/extensions and moves the main command to the compose group, and another that refractor and fixes the classes and CLI. On the SciCookie project, our team has added a smoke test for pyenv.
