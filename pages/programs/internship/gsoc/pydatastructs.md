# PyDataStructs

`1.0.1` will be the first release of pydatastructs.

The data structures and algorithms listed below, should be added before we go for our first release. The list doesn't contain what's already there in master and hence all of the following ideas are open for work.

## Bioinformatics Algorithms

* Needleman–Wunsch algorithm
* Smith–Waterman algorithm
* Hirschberg's algorithm

## Backends

* Implementing C++ backend for all the APIs

Potential mentor: Gagandeep Singh
