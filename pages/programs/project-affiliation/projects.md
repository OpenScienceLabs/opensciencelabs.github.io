# Affiliated Projects

We proudly showcase a curated list of innovative and diverse projects that are
part of the Open Science Labs family. Each of these projects embodies our
commitment to open science and technology, and they play a pivotal role in
driving forward our shared goals. These collaborations not only strengthen our
community but also contribute significantly to the broader field of open source
and scientific research. Below, you'll find information about each project.

## [ArtBox](https://osl-incubator.github.io/artbox/)

ArtBox is a tool set for handling multimedia files with a bunch of useful
functions.

## [ArxLang](https://arxlang.github.io/)

ArxLang Project is compounded mainly by three sub-projects: ASTx, IRx, and Arx.

ASTx is an agnostic expression structure for AST. It is agnostic because it is
not specific to any language, neither to the ArxLang project, although its main
focus is to provide all needed feature for ArxLang.

IRx aims to provide a translator to LLVM-IR from ASTx objects.

Arx is a new programming language that uses the power of LLVM to provide a
multi-architecture machine target code generation.

## [Envers](https://osl-incubator.github.io/envers/)

Envers is a command-line tool (CLI) designed to manage and version environment
variables for different deployment stages such as staging, development, and
production. It provides a secure and organized way to handle
environment-specific configurations.

## [PyDataStructs](https://pydatastructs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

PyDataStructs project aims to be a Python package for various data structures
and algorithms (including their parallel implementations).

---

## [SciCookie](https://osl-incubator.github.io/scicookie)

SciCookie is a template developed by <https://opensciencelabs.org/> that creates
projects from project templates.

---

## [Sugar](https://osl-incubator.github.io/sugar/)

Sugar aims to organize your stack of containers, gathering some useful scripts
and keeping this information centralized in a configuration file. So the command
line would be very simple.
