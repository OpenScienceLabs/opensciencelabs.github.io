# Google Summer of Code (GSoC) with Open Science Labs, under NumFOCUS umbrella

## Google Summer of Code (GSoC)

Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on bringing more student
developers into open source software development. GSoC invites students to work
with an open source organization on a 3-month programming project during their
break from school.

## Open Science Labs' Participation in GSoC under NumFOCUS umbrella

Open Science Labs is excited to announce that we've been accepted under
[NumFOCUS](https://github.com/numfocus/gsoc) umbrella as a participating
organization in GSoC 2024! Please, check out our
[list of projects](https://github.com/OpenScienceLabs/gsoc/blob/main/project-ideas/gsoc2024.md)
for more details.

## Contributor Guide

Candidates and contributors can find important information about GSoC in the
[Contributor Guide](/programs/gsoc/guides/contributor).

## Our Project Ideas for GSoC

We have carefully curated a list of project ideas that not only align with our
vision at OSL but also offer challenging and rewarding experiences for student
developers. These projects span a range of topics and technologies, ensuring
there's something to engage every interested student. We believe these projects
offer an excellent opportunity for students to contribute to significant open
source initiatives while enhancing their skills and knowledge under the guidance
of experienced mentors.

This year, we are participating in GSoC with the following project ideas:
