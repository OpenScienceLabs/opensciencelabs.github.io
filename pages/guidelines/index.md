## Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)

Open Science Labs (OSL) is a community that offers an open space to share, learn
and teach topics related to Open Science and Computational Technologies to
people from Latin America or any part of the world.

DEI is a very important aspect of our community and we really care about that.

In this section we can find our initial DEI declaration.

progress), and our goal is to have the necessary information for anyone who
wants to help us in the DevOps tasks.

## Mentoring

In this section, there are documents about Open Science Labs Mentoring program.
The mentoring could be running as a community mentoring, where someone from the
community for the mentoring program and Open Science Labs tries to find one
mentor inside our community, using discord, or using the social media, in order
to reach someone outside.

Another way that the mentoring can happen is inside the internship program.
