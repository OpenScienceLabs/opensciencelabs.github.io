# Study Groups at Open Science Labs

## About Our Study Groups

At Open Science Labs, we encourage the formation of study groups to create a
collaborative environment where members can learn and share knowledge on various
topics. Whether you're looking to improve your problem-solving skills or dive
into new technological realms, our study groups offer a place to grow alongside
peers under the guidance of experienced moderators.

## Current Study Groups

### Advent of Code

Currently, sponsored by LiteRev, we host a study group focused on enhancing
problem-solving skills through the
[**Advent of Code challenges**](https://adventofcode.com/). This initiative
provides an engaging way to tackle interesting programming problems and improve
your coding proficiency.

### Python 101 Challenges

For those just stepping into the world of Python, we're excited to announce the
upcoming "Python 101 Challenges" study group. This beginner-level group is
designed to help you tackle fundamental Python problems, making it an ideal
starting point for those new to coding.

### Creative Coding

Our group will explore coding as a creative process rather than just a technical
skill. Many beginners find programming intimidating and miss out on the
enjoyment it can offer. By using code to create graphics, we can make learning
more approachable and visually rewarding. This study group will center around
programming with P5.js, an open-source JavaScript framework designed for
creative coding.

- **Schedule**: _Alternate Saturday at 10:00 PM (GMT+5:30)_
- **Video Call**: [Google Meet](https://calendar.app.google/x2BLjFu6J55jCoHq5)
- **Challenge link**: [p5.js tutorials](https://p5js.org/tutorials/)


### Neuronauts: The AI Expedition

study group focused on exploring the fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence,
Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. In this group, members dive into both 
the theory and practical applications of AI, moving beyond surface-level use of APIs and automated tools.
Participants will engage in discussions, work on projects, and
tackle exercises that help build a solid understanding of the 
underlying principles of AI.
