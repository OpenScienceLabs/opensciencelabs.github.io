## Unpaid Internships

Open Science Labs has so far operated with a constrained budget and is in the process of seeking new and continuous funding opportunities. While that is yet to become a reality, OSL is only able to afford unpaid internships. We ask proposing candidates to value and cherish these opportunities as the program mentors also dedicate  their time and effort without any compensations.
