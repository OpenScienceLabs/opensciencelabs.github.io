# Our Fiscal Sponsor: The GRAPH Network

Open Science Labs (OSL) is proud to be in partnership with The GRAPH Network, an
esteemed organization dedicated to fostering research and development across
various domains. Acting as our fiscal sponsor, The GRAPH Network plays a crucial
role in the financial management of our projects, enabling us to focus on what
we do best: driving innovation and collaboration in open science.

## Legal Representation and Support

The GRAPH Network operates under the legal representation of ASCRES, which
serves as the legal entity managing our fiscal responsibilities. This
partnership simplifies the complex bureaucracy often associated with managing
funds and paying collaborators, allowing OSL to devote more energy towards our
projects and community initiatives.

## Financial Management and Fees

A crucial aspect of our collaboration involves the financial management of
incoming funds for projects. To ensure the smooth operation of this process,
ASCRES/The GRAPH Network charges a fixed fee of 30% of the incoming funds. This
fee covers the costs associated with bureaucratic tasks, including legal fees
and personnel involved in managing these operations.

In addition to the fiscal management fee, OSL also allocates a 30% fee from
incoming funds to support our ongoing operations, including server maintenance,
domain registration, and funding new initiatives. While the majority of our
contributors currently volunteer their time and expertise, our goal is to move
towards compensating all individuals involved in our projects.

## Requirements for Grant Proposal or Funding Requests

In any grant proposal or funding request, it is essential to explicitly mention
ASCRES/The GRAPH Network to ensure the proper receipt and management of funds.
It also ensures that all parties involved are acknowledged and supported
throughout the process.

## Looking Ahead

Our collaboration with The GRAPH Network and ASCRES is more than just a fiscal
sponsorship; it's a partnership that empowers us to achieve our mission of
promoting open science and technology. As we continue to grow and support more
projects, we are grateful for the stability and support that The GRAPH Network
provides. Together, we are making strides towards a future where open science
can flourish, thanks to the dedication and hard work of everyone involved.
