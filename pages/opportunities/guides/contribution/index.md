# Contribution Guidelines

These recommendations are general guidelines from Open Science Labs. Each
project may have its own specific set of recommendations and rules; contributors
should review those for each project.

## Community Engagement

- **Communication Platforms:** Each project may use its preferred communication
  platform for discussions, such as code repository platforms (GitHub, GitLab,
  etc.) or chat-based platforms (Discord, Slack, etc.). Contributors should
  verify with the community and mentors which platform is recommended for
  seeking assistance, discussing ideas, and requesting reviews.

- **Collaboration and Support:** Contributors are encouraged to assist others
  when possible, as everyone is here to learn and support one another.

- **Respect and Inclusivity:** Contributors should communicate with kindness and
  respect, particularly when interacting with beginners or colleagues for whom
  English may not be their first language. Instead of engaging in arguments,
  they should offer constructive feedback and encouragement to help others
  improve both their language and technical skills.

- **Channel Usage:** If the primary discussion channel is not the code
  repository platform, contributors should use the designated platform to draw
  attention to pull requests or issues. Initiating a discussion there prior to
  opening issues or pull requests is also expected.

## Contributions

- **Task Coordination:** Contributors should avoid duplicating work by verifying
  whether someone else is already addressing a task or if the task remains
  relevant before beginning work.

- **Managing Stale Contributions:** Project maintainers may implement mechanisms
  to label and close stale issues and pull requests. Some contributors open pull
  requests without following up or addressing review recommendations, which can
  impede progress.

- **Branch Management:** When updating a branch, contributors should follow the
  project's preferred approach, whether that involves using a **rebase** or a
  **merge commit**.

- If your PR is not ready yet for review, please keep it in **draft mode**.

## Coding Tips

- Ensure that `pre-commit` is applied to your branch before opening a pull
  request. Run `pre-commit install` to enable pre-commit hooks, ensuring they
  are applied automatically before every commit.
- Avoid excessive nesting. Try to keep nesting levels to **four or fewer** for
  better readability and maintainability.
- Follow the project's specific coding guidelines. Review them regularly to
  ensure consistency across contributions.
- Remove any unnecessary comments. In most cases, if you need to explain what
  your code does, it may indicate that the code is unclear or overly complex.
  This is also often a sign of code generated by Generative AI.
- Do not use emojis in comments. This is typically seen as a red flag and may
  suggest improper use of AI-generated content.
- Ensure there is an empty line at the end of each file. GitHub highlights
  missing end-of-file newlines with a red icon. Configure your IDE to
  automatically add this final newline.
