# Open Science Labs Projects

Open Science Labs (OSL) champions the intersection of open science and
open-source technology, fostering a vibrant community where researchers,
developers, and enthusiasts can collaborate and innovate. OSL supports this
mission through robust programs designed to facilitate growth and development.

## Incubator and Affiliated Projects

### Incubator Program

The **Incubator Program** at OSL supports emerging open-source libraries and
tools to support scientific and general projects, providing them with necessary
resources, mentorship, and a collaborative community. Projects in this program
benefit from guidance on best practices in open-source development and
scientific research, helping to enhance their visibility and impact.

### Affiliation Benefits

Projects that become affiliated with OSL enjoy several advantages. They gain
eligibility to participate in special programs such as the OSL Internship
Program, the Google Summer of Code, and potentially receive OSL Development
Grants aimed at accelerating their growth and expanding their reach within the
global community.

## Internship Program

The **Internship Program** offers hands-on experience to aspiring professionals
by pairing them with both incubated and affiliated projects under the OSL
umbrella. Modeled after successful initiatives like Google Summer of Code, this
program allows interns to work on substantive projects, sharpening their skills
and contributing to significant advancements in open science.

## Bridging Theory and Practice

Through these initiatives, OSL is dedicated to transforming theoretical
knowledge into practical application, fostering a dynamic environment where
continuous learning and active contribution drive scientific progress. Whether
you are developing an innovative project or seeking to engage with the
open-source community, OSL provides the resources and platform to thrive.
