# OSL Project Ideas for GSoC 2025

Welcome to the Open Science Labs (OSL) project ideas page for Google Summer of
Code 2025. As an umbrella organization, OSL hosts links to the ideas pages of
each member organization. You can explore these projects here.

At OSL, we've assembled a selection of project ideas that not only embody our
mission but also provide enriching experiences for student and newcomers
open-source developpers. These projects cover a variety of topics and
technologies, catering to diverse interests. Below, we've outlined some
potential project ideas we're considering for GSoC. We believe these projects
provide students with a valuable chance to engage with open-source efforts and
develop their skills under the mentorship of seasoned professionals.
