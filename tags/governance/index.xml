The objectives of this document include formalizing the governance of the Open Science Labs (OSL) project. In both common and uncommon situations, outlining the decision-making procedure and the interactions between the various members of our community, including the relationship between work that may be supported by for-profit or nonprofit organizations and open source collaborative development.
Summary OSL is a community-owned and community-run project. To the maximum extent possible, decisions about project direction are made by community consensus (but note that &amp;quot;consensus&amp;quot; here has a somewhat technical meaning that might not match everyone's expectations -- see below).</description></item></channel></rss>
