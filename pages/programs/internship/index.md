# Open Science Labs Internship Program

The Open Science Labs Internship Program aims to promote the engagement of a
wider audience in the realm of open-source software development.

## Program Features

Each intern will be paired with a mentor who is an active member of the
community. The mentor will provide guidance to the intern in achieving the
specific goals of the internship. The internship will involve a series of
activities and contributions to open-source projects. The internship is expected
to have a minimum duration of 2 months and a maximum of six months.

[The Graph Network](https://thegraphnetwork.org), legally represented by
[ASCRES](https://site.ascres.org/site/), is our Fiscal Sponsor and will be in
charge of all the necessary paperwork.

Currently, we are aiming students from Bolivian Universities, but we will open
for other countries soon.

## Stages of the Internship Program

### Call for Applications and Selection

Once the projects for the internship program are defined, a call for
applications will be announced for interested candidates (duration: 2 weeks).

The selection process, overseen by project mentors and maintainers, will last
for 1 week.

Upon completion of the selection process, necessary formalities will be
conducted to finalize the onboarding.

### Internship

Throughout the internship, students will be required to submit monthly reports
detailing their activities. These reports will include a record of hours spent
and milestones achieved.

### Completion of the Internship Program

The internship will conclude upon fulfilling the stipulated hours, at which
point a certificate will be issued to acknowledge the successful completion of
the internship. The internship may also be terminated if the intern consistently
misses scheduled meetings or fails to meet agreed-upon activity milestones.

## Requirements to Join the Internship Program

Proficiency in English at least to an intermediate level. Basic knowledge
related to the project to which the intern intends to contribute. Agreement to
adhere to the established Codes of Conduct within the community.

projects.
