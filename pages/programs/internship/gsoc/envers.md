# Envers

## Project Idea 1: Improve the Initial Structure of Envers

### Abstract

This proposal outlines a structured approach to enhancing 'Envers', a
command-line tool designed for efficient and secure management of environment
variables across various deployment stages, including staging, development, and
production. Envers leverages uses encryption in order to ensure a high level of
security in configuration management.

The proposal for OSL Internship Program aims to implement several key
improvements to Envers, focusing on both functionality enhancement and code
quality. The specific tasks include:

1. **Password Management Enhancement**:

   - Implement a feature to allow users to change the encryption password. This
     is critical for maintaining security, especially in scenarios where
     password compromise is suspected.

2. **Selective Profile Loading**:

   - Enhance the `profile-load` command to support loading of specific
     environment files. This feature will provide users with greater flexibility
     in managing different environment configurations.

3. **Support for Xonsh Environment Variables**:

   - Introduce the capability to handle 'xonsh' shell environment variables.
     This will extend Envers' applicability to a broader range of development
     environments.
   - Implement rendering of these variables in the `profile-load` process,
     thereby integrating seamlessly with existing functionalities.

4. **Documentation Improvement**:

   - Revise and augment the existing documentation to reflect new features and
     provide clear, concise, and up-to-date guidance for users. This includes
     expanding on usage examples, detailing new command options, and updating
     the setup instructions.

5. **Enhanced Testing**:
   - Strengthen the unit and smoke test suites to ensure comprehensive coverage
     and robustness of the application. This includes adding tests for new
     features and refining existing tests for better reliability and efficiency.
