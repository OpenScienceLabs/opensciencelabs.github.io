# Internship/Apprenticeship Program

Welcome to the Open Science Labs (OSL) Internship/Apprenticeship Program! At the
heart of our mission lies the commitment to foster innovation and growth within
the realm of open science and open source. This program is an embodiment of that
commitment, providing an inclusive, dynamic, and nurturing environment for
contributors of all backgrounds-whether you're a student stepping into the world
of open-source, or a professional looking to give back and refine your skills.

This program is under [The GRAPH Network](https://thegraphnetwork.org) who
enhances our reach and impact across the open science community.

With a structure inspired by the Google Summer of Code, our program offers some
unique features:

- **Open Participation**: We welcome everyone from students to professionals,
  embracing diversity in knowledge and experience.
- **Flexible Commitment**: A minimum of 20 hours per week allows for impactful
  work while accommodating your schedule.
- **Biannual Cycles**: With two distinct cycles per year, there are ample
  opportunities to get involved at a time that suits you best.
- **End-of-Cycle Presentations**: At the end of each cycle, participants are
  encouraged to share their journey and project outcomes, enhancing their public
  speaking and technical communication skills.
- **Non-Monetary Rewards**: While the internship does not offer financial
  compensation, it offers invaluable experience, mentorship, networking
  opportunities, and the satisfaction of contributing to open-source projects
  that matter.

In this program, contributors will not only gain practical experience by working
on real-world projects but also become an integral part of a community striving
for a collective goal—advancing open source and open science for a better
future.

## Requirements

### Contributor Candidate Requirements

For those interested in taking advantage of the Open Science Labs
Internship/Apprenticeship Program, there are several key requirements that
ensure a productive and rewarding experience for both the contributor and the
program:

- **English Proficiency**: Candidates must be able to effectively communicate in
  English, as it is the primary language used for collaboration and
  communication within the program.
- **Age Requirement**: All candidates must be at least 18 years old at the time
  of applying to participate in the program.
- **Time Commitment**: Prospective interns are expected to dedicate a minimum of
  20 hours per week to the program throughout the cycle, which spans 3 months.
- **Duration of Commitment**: Candidates must be prepared to commit to the full
  duration of the program cycle to ensure continuity and impact of their
  contributions.
- **Nature of Opportunity**: It's important to note that this is a non-paid
  opportunity, ideal for those looking to gain experience and grow their network
  in the open science community.
- **Initial Contribution**: Before official acceptance, candidates should make a
  small contribution to their project of interest. This allows mentors to assess
  the candidate’s skills and commitment levels.

We seek candidates who are passionate about open science and eager to make
significant contributions to the open-source community. If you meet these
requirements and are ready to engage with cutting-edge projects, we encourage
you to apply.

### Requirements for Sub-Organizations

To join the Open Science Labs Internship/Apprenticeship Program as a
sub-organization, the following criteria must be met:

- **Open Source Licensing**: The project(s) must be released under a license
  approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) or have a Software Package Data
  Exchange (SPDX) identifier. Licenses not recognized by OSI will be subject to
  review to ensure alignment with the program's objectives.
- **Issue Availability**: There should be an array of open issues available for
  the duration of the program cycle, offering a variety of engagement
  opportunities for contributors.
- **Mentorship**: Each project under the sub-organization must have at least one
  mentor committed to guiding contributors. However, for a robust mentoring
  experience, having at least two mentors per project is recommended.
- **Application Submission**: The application to join as a sub-organization must
  be submitted by a core contributor or a maintainer of the project or
  organization to ensure commitment and reliability.
- **Code of Conduct**: All projects looking to participate must adhere to a
  publicly visible code of conduct to ensure a safe, inclusive, and respectful
  environment for all contributors.

By fulfilling these requirements, your sub-organization will contribute to a
productive and ethical collaboration space, supporting the growth of
contributors and the advancement of open-source projects through our
internship/apprenticeship program.

For more information about the Cycle 2024-01 Timeline, check its official page:
<https://opensciencelabs.org/programs/internship/cycles/2024-01/#timeline>

### Cycle 2: 2024 (Estimated Timeline & GSoC Alignment)

- **April, 22**: Call for Interns/Apprentices opens.
- **May, 13**: Deadline for Interns/Apprentices applications.
- **May, 20**: Announcement of approved Interns/Apprentices and start of bounding period
- **May, 27**: Official Start Date of Internship Period; an alternative for
  projects not selected by GSoC to run under the OSL Internship Program with The
  Graph Network support.
- **July, 8**: Mid-term Evaluation.

**Notes:**

- **GSoC Alignment Note**: Open Science Labs (OSL) is planning to participate as
  a Mentoring Organization in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC). Consequently,
  our Cycle 2 timeline is designed to align with the GSoC schedule. However,
  please be aware that OSL's inclusion in GSoC is not guaranteed, and we will
  confirm our participation status as soon as we have information.
- **GSoC Application Note**: If OSL is accepted into GSoC, all projects intended
  for Cycle 2 will be submitted as part of our GSoC application. This submission
  will aim to provide our projects and their prospective contributors the
  opportunity to benefit from the structure, support, and recognition that GSoC
  provides.
- **Cycle 2 Timeline**: The above estimates for Cycle 2 are tentative and should
  be adjusted according to the actual GSoC schedule once announced.
- **OSL Internship Contingency Plan**: In the event that a project is not
  accepted into GSoC, there's no need to worry. These projects will have the
  opportunity to proceed within the regular OSL Internship/Apprenticeship
  Program, following the same planned timeline. We believe in providing a
  platform for all valuable projects, ensuring that they have the chance to move
  forward and thrive with or without GSoC inclusion.

By preparing for these possibilities, OSL is committed to supporting project
continuity and offering a stable, enriching internship experience to all
participants.
