# Open Science Labs (OSL) Packaging Support Program

## Laying the Groundwork for Conda Packaging

At Open Science Labs, we're laying the groundwork for a future-focused Packaging
Support Program. Our vision is to assist projects with packaging libraries
within the robust Conda/Conda-Forge ecosystem. While our full suite of services
is still under development, we are currently engaged in internal activities
aimed at equipping our associated projects with the knowledge and skills
necessary to begin packaging with Conda-Forge.

### Current Initiatives

Our present efforts center on:

- **Internal Training**: Offering guidance and support to our affiliated
  projects as they navigate the intricacies of Conda and Conda-Forge.
- **Foundation Building**: Establishing the baseline practices and
  infrastructure required for effective Conda packaging.

### Future Plans

Looking ahead, we are excited about the potential to expand our support, which
will include:

- **Comprehensive Training**: Developing training programs to help the wider
  community in packaging and distribution.
- **On-Demand Packaging**: Providing targeted assistance to projects needing to
  package and distribute their libraries effectively.

### Get Involved

As we build these initiatives, we invite you to:

1. **Stay Tuned**: Watch for updates on the rollout of our full Packaging
   Support Program.
2. **Get Familiar**: Start by learning about Conda and Conda-Forge, and explore
   how packaging can benefit your projects.
3. **Prepare for the Future**: Consider how enhanced packaging support can
   address distribution challenges within your projects.

We're excited to pave the way for advanced packaging solutions within the OSL
community. Join us in this journey, and let's push the boundaries of open
science together!
