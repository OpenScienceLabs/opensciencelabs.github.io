## Open Source Software (OSS) Internships

Open Science Labs (OSL) provides a valuable opportunity for newcomers to
open-source software development through its internship program. This program is
designed to deepen participants' understanding of open-source tools and best
practices in a real-world setting. We invite candidates to seize this chance to
enhance their skills and contribute to real projects.

## Open Source Software (OSS) Research Seed Internships

Open Source Software (OSS) Research Seed Program is a new initiative at Open
Science Labs designed to help researchers start open source projects from
scratch. The program requires researchers to provide clear documentation,
detailed GitHub issues, and a structured project plan for a 3â€“6 month internship
period, with all projects released under an open source license.

Interns typically work on an unpaid basis, helping to advance these projects
while gaining practical experience. Where available, project maintainers can
compensate interns through our fiscal host,
[Open Source Collective](https://opencollective.com/osl). Mentors are expected
to commit at least 5 hours per week, with daily reviews recommended to monitor
progress and provide feedback.

Overall, the program supports early-stage project development through
collaboration between interns and experienced mentors, helping new projects
integrate into the broader open source community.
