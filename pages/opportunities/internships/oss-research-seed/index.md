# Open Source Software (OSS) Research Seed Internship Program

This document provides guidelines for both open-source research project
maintainers and internship candidates for the OSS Research Seed Internship
Program at Open Science Labs (OSL).

## Overview

The OSS Research Seed Internship Program is designed to support research
projects that deliver open source software. At OSL, we are committed to bridging
the gap between academic research and practical software development by helping
researchers launch new projects from scratch.

The program emphasizes creating a viable open-source deliverable through the
collaboration of interns and active mentorship from the project's author. This
initiative operates in partnership with The GRAPH Network, ensuring a structured
and supportive environment for project development.

## Program Structure

Modeled after initiatives like Google Summer of Code, the program includes:

- **Open Participation:** Applications are welcome from students, researchers,
  and professionals interested in transforming research ideas into functional
  open-source research projects. Applicants should submit their project
  proposals directly to designated mentors.
- **Flexible Commitment:** Participants are expected to commit a minimum of 20
  hours per week for a period of 3 to 6 months, depending on the projectâ€™s scope
  and the candidate's availability.
- **Rolling Applications:** Candidates may apply at any time, ensuring
  continuous access to the program without the constraints of fixed cycles.
- **Mentorship and Support:** Each project is paired with a mentor who commits
  at least 5 hours per week to provide daily feedback and support via a public
  communication channel (e.g., Discord).
- **Continuous Reporting:** Interns are expected to document their progress in a
  blog post (on OSL Blog) through periodic blog posts (every one or two weeks),
  detailing the tasks completed during that period. We recommend breaking down
  tasks into small, manageable pull requests to facilitate frequent updates.
- **Compensation Options:** Although the internship is primarily unpaid, project
  maintainers may choose to offer compensation through our fiscal host, the
  [Open Source Collective](https://opencollective.com/osl), if funding is
  available.

## Requirements for Internship Candidates

Candidates should meet the following criteria:

- **English Proficiency:** Effective communication in English is required for
  collaboration.
- **Age Requirement:** Applicants must be at least 18 years old.
- **Time Commitment:** A minimum of 20 hours per week is required during the
  internship period.
- **Opportunity Nature:** This is primarily an unpaid internship designed to
  provide practical experience and build professional networks. If any
  compensation is available, it will be specified by the mentors in the
  internship announcement.
- **Initial Contribution:** Candidates must demonstrate commitment by making a
  preliminary contribution to their chosen project, allowing mentors to assess
  their skills and dedication.
- **Project Criteria:** Proposals must include a detailed description, a set of
  initial GitHub issues, and a structured project plan for the internship
  period. All projects must be licensed under an OSI-approved open source
  license. Please check our template
  [here](/opportunities/internships/templates/candidate-proposal).

## Guidelines for Open-Source Research Project Contributors

If you are a maintainer or core contributor of an open-source research project,
you can submit your project for affiliation with OSL and eligibility for this
internship program. Please send a link to your project proposal to
`team@opensciencelabs.org` using the template provided
[here](/opportunities/internships/templates/projects-ideas).

Although pre-existing code is not required to apply for this program, each
project must have an open repository (e.g., on GitHub or GitLab) with open
issues detailing the planned activities and documentation outlining the project
idea (for example, on the project wiki). The project idea should include a
detailed description, a set of initial GitHub issues, and a structured project
plan for the internship period. All projects must be licensed under an
OSI-approved open source license.

Affiliated projects will benefit from intern contributions, receive community
support, and, where available, secure funding to support further development.

This program offers a pathway for individuals to turn research ideas into
tangible open-source projects. If you meet the requirements and are passionate
about contributing to the open science community, we encourage you to apply.
