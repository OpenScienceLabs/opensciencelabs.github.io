# Google Summer of Code (GSoC) at Open Science Labs

Open Science Labs plans to apply for GSoC 2026. Stay tuned!

## About Google Summer of Code

Google Summer of Code offers students worldwide the chance to contribute to open
source projects over the summer. This initiative is not only about coding; it's
about learning the open source culture, understanding project maintenance, and
improving software alongside experienced mentors.

For more information about GSoC, check out its official web page at
<https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/>.

### Why Participate with OSL?

OSL has participated in GSoC since 2023: in 2023 and 2024 as a NumFOCUS
sub-organization, and in 2025 as an independent Mentoring Organization.

OSL provides robust support to budding open-source enthusiasts through
structured projects that enhance both learning and contribution.

### Project Ideas Submission

Mentors play a crucial role at GSoC, providing guidance and expertise to help
shape the next generation of open source contributors. If you have a project
that could use enhancements or require tricky bug fixes, please propose your
ideas. We welcome initial drafts, and if accepted, there will be time to refine
these ideas further.

The current list of project ideas can be found
[here](/opportunities/gsoc/project-ideas).

If you are considering submitting your project idea to OSL, please send your
project by email to <team@opensciencelabs.org> by January 31, 2026. Check out
our project idea template for more insights:
