projects:
  - name: ArtBox
    type: incubated
    url: https://osl-incubator.github.io/artbox/
    description: |
      ArtBox is a tool set for handling multimedia files with a bunch of useful
      functions.
  - name: ArxLang
    type: affiliated
    url: https://arxlang.org
    description: |
      ArxLang Project is compounded mainly by three sub-projects: ASTx, IRx, and Arx.
      ASTx is an agnostic expression structure for AST. It is agnostic because it is
      not specific to any language, neither to the ArxLang project, although its main
      focus is to provide all needed feature for ArxLang.
      IRx aims to provide a translator to LLVM-IR from ASTx objects.
      Arx is a new programming language that uses the power of LLVM to provide a
      multi-architecture machine target code generation.

  - name: Envers
    type: incubated
    url: https://osl-incubator.github.io/envers/
    description: |
      Envers is a command-line tool (CLI) designed to manage and version environment
      variables for different deployment stages such as staging, development, and
      production. It provides a secure and organized way to handle
      environment-specific configurations.

  - name: fqlearn
    type: incubated
    url: https://osl-pocs.github.io/fqlearn/
    description: |
      This Project aims to facilitate the teaching of unit operations and
      thermodynamics.

  - name: Makim
    type: incubated
    url: https://osl-incubator.github.io/makim/
    description: |
      Makim (or makim) is based on make and focus on improve the way to define targets
      and dependencies. Instead of using the Makefile format, it uses yaml format.

  - name: noWorkflow
    type: affiliated
    url: https://gems-uff.github.io/noworkflow/
    description: |
      The noWorkflow project aims at allowing scientists to benefit from provenance
      data analysis even when they don't use a workflow system. It transparently
      collects provenance from Python scripts and notebooks and provide tools to
      support the analysis and management of the provenance.

  - name: PyDataStructs
    type: affiliated
    url: https://pydatastructs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
    description: |
      PyDataStructs project aims to be a Python package for various data structures
      and algorithms (including their parallel implementations).

  - name: SciCookie
    type: incubated
    url: https://osl-incubator.github.io/scicookie
    description: |
      SciCookie is a template developed by Open Science Labs that creates
      projects from project templates.

  - name: Sugar
    type: incubated
    url: https://osl-incubator.github.io/sugar/
    description: |
      Sugar aims to organize your stack of containers, gathering some useful scripts
      and keeping this information centralized in a configuration file. So the command
      line would be very simple.
