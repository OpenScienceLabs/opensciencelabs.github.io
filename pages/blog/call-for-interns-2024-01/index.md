<!-- # Intro -->

This program presents valuable opportunities for both mentors and student/collaborators to engage and grow, despite being an unpaid initiative.

## Initial Guidelines for Internship Program Candidates:
---

Candidates are encouraged to thoroughly explore project options aligning with their skills and interests. This involves a careful review of project ideas and documentation.

Once a candidate identifies a preferred project, they should initiate contact with the mentor via email. The email should include:

* Personal Introduction
* Curriculum Vitae
* The project name
* Project idea name
* Motivation for wanting to collaborate on that specific project.

Additionally, candidates must confirm their availability for the entire 3-month duration of the project.

Upon mentor acceptance, candidates will be assigned preliminary tasks, such as documentation updates and bug fixes. This step enables the mentor to assess the candidate's capability to handle the project tasks effectively.

Successful completion of these initial assignments will prompt the mentor to guide the candidate in applying for the Open Science Labs Internship Program through <http://tinyurl.com/osl-internship-intern-proposal>.

Candidates are reminded of the importance of having prior knowledge of Git. Additionally, candidates should join the [OSL Discord](https://opensciencelabs.org/discord) to stay updated on announcements related to the Internship Program.

Recognizing the value of skill enhancement, Open Science Labs organizes study groups that candidates are encouraged to participate in, further refining their abilities.

## Guidelines for Approved Interns:
---

* **Communication:** Proactive communication is encouraged, with frequent updates through appropriate channels. Approved interns should use OSL Blog to document their experiences.
* **Continuous Learning:** Interns are advised to study project technologies, participate in study groups, and regularly write about their experiences on the OSL Blog.
* **Evaluations:** The internship includes midterm and final evaluations, allowing mentors to assess progress and students/collaborators to evaluate their contributions.
