<p>The objectives of this document include formalizing the governance of the Open
Science Labs (OSL) project. In both common and uncommon situations, outlining
the decision-making procedure and the interactions between the various members
of our community, including the relationship between work that may be supported
by for-profit or nonprofit organizations and open source collaborative
development.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link"> #</a></h2>
<p>OSL is a community-owned and community-run project. To the maximum extent
possible, decisions about project direction are made by community consensus (but
note that "consensus" here has a somewhat technical meaning that might not match
everyone's expectations -- see below). Some members of the community
additionally contribute by serving on the OSL (Eunice Rodas, Ever Vino, Ivan
Ogasawara, Luis Casas), where they are responsible for facilitating the
establishment of community consensus, for stewarding project resources, and --
in extreme cases -- for making project decisions if the normal community-based
process breaks down.</p>
<p>Commonly, everyone is responsible for specific areas or tasks and, if there is
anything that needs to be decided by the group, this person brings this topic to
one of our contributor's meetings and we can discuss and decide that together.
The main criteria we have that should be respected is that the content should be
related to an "open" topic (private technologies are not allowed, for example),
and the access to that information should also be open (references to private
content is not allowed neither). So, we try to have an open space for everyone
to bring their ideas and have also the space to implement that idea as well, the
steering council first main goal is to help contributors to share their ideas
before to put it in practice.</p>
<h2 id="the-project">The project<a class="headerlink" href="#the-project" title="Permanent link"> #</a></h2>
<p>Open Science Labs (OSL) is a community that aims to join people from all parts
of the world, specially from Latin America countries and create an open space
for teaching, learning and sharing topics around open science and open
computational tools.</p>
<p>OSL also motivates initiatives about English language because it increases the
possibilities of collaboration in open projects across the world.</p>
<p>The software developed by OSL initiatives are released under some OSI approved
license (such as BSD, Apache 2.0, or MIT), built openly and hosted on public
GitHub repositories under the OpenScienceLabs organization.</p>
<p>The Project is conducted by a distributed team of contributors, who are
individuals that have collaborated with code, documentation, graphical design or
other kind of work to the Project. Anyone can be a Contributor. Contributors can
be affiliated with any legal entity or none. Contributors participate in the
project by submitting, reviewing and discussing GitHub pull requests and issues
and participating in open and public Project discussions on GitHub, discord,
among other channels. The basis of project participation is openness and
transparency.</p>
<p>The Project Community consists of all Contributors and Users of the Project.
Contributors work on behalf of and are responsible to the larger Project
Community and we strive to keep the barrier between Contributors and Users as
low as possible.</p>
<p>In order to improve transparency and a better fiscal workflow, OSL is currently
looking for a fiscal sponsor to help our project to grow.</p>
<h2 id="governance">Governance<a class="headerlink" href="#governance" title="Permanent link"> #</a></h2>
<p>This section describes the governance and leadership model of The Project.</p>
<p>The principles of Project governance are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Openness &amp; Transparency</li>
<li>Active Contribution</li>
<li>Institutional Neutrality</li>
<li>Diversity, Equity and Inclusion</li>
<li>Education</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="consensus-based-decision-making-by-the-community">Consensus-based decision making by the community<a class="headerlink" href="#consensus-based-decision-making-by-the-community" title="Permanent link"> #</a></h3>
<p>In general, all project decisions will be made by consensus of all interested
Contributors. The primary goal of this approach is to ensure that the people who
are most affected by and involved in any given change can contribute their
knowledge in the confidence that their voices will be heard, because thoughtful
review from a broad community is the best mechanism we know of for creating
high-quality software.</p>
<p>The mechanism we use to accomplish this goal may be unfamiliar for those who are
not experienced with the cultural norms around free/open-source software
development. We provide a summary here, and highly recommend that all
Contributors additionally read Chapter 4: Social and Political Infrastructure of
Karl Fogel's classic Producing Open Source Software, and in particular the
section on Consensus-based Democracy, for a more detailed discussion.</p>
<p>In this context, consensus does NOT require:</p>
<ul>
<li>that we wait to solicit everybody's opinion on every change,</li>
<li>that we ever hold a vote on anything, or</li>
<li>that everybody is happy or agrees with every decision.</li>
</ul>
<p>For us, what consensus means is that we entrust everyone with the right to veto
any change if they feel it necessary. While this may sound like a recipe for
obstruction and pain, this is not what happens. Instead, we find that most
people take this responsibility seriously, and only invoke their veto when they
judge that a serious problem is being ignored, and that their veto is necessary
to protect the project. And in practice, it turns out that such vetoes are
almost never formally invoked, because their mere possibility ensures that
Contributors are motivated from the start to find some solution that everyone
can live with -- thus accomplishing our goal of ensuring that all interested
perspectives are taken into account.</p>
<p>How do we know when consensus has been achieved? First of all, this is rather
difficult since consensus is defined by the absence of vetos, which requires us
to somehow prove a negative. In practice, we use a combination of our best
judgement (e.g., a simple and uncontroversial bug fix posted on GitHub and
reviewed by a core developer is probably fine) and best efforts (e.g., all
substantive API changes must be posted to a github issue or a discussion on
discord in order to give the broader community a chance to catch any problems
and suggest improvements; we assume that anyone who cares enough about OSL to
invoke their veto right should be on the github OSL repositories or discord).
OSL, is a small group, and aims for quick and transparent communication, so the
common channels for communication are the github issues and the discord
channels. So, all people involved can have a quick and transparent communication
about any specific problem and we can react very quick.</p>
<p>If one does need to invoke a formal veto, then the process should consist of:</p>
<ul>
<li>an unambiguous statement that a veto is being invoked,</li>
<li>an explanation of why it is being invoked, and</li>
<li>a description of what conditions (if any) would convince the vetoer to
  withdraw their veto.</li>
</ul>
<p>If all proposals for resolving some issue are vetoed, then the status quo wins
by default.</p>
<p>In the worst case, if a Contributor is genuinely misusing their veto
obstructively to the detriment of the project, then they can be ejected from the
project by consensus of the Steering Council -- see below.</p>
<h3 id="steering-council">Steering Council<a class="headerlink" href="#steering-council" title="Permanent link"> #</a></h3>
<p>The Project will have a Steering Council that consists of Project Contributors
who have produced contributions that are substantial in quality and quantity,
and sustained over at least one year. The overall role of the Council is to
ensure, with input from the Community, the long-term well-being of the project,
both technically and as a community.</p>
<p>During the everyday project activities, council members participate in all
discussions, code review and other project activities as peers with all other
Contributors and the Community. In these everyday activities, Council Members do
not have any special power or privilege through their membership on the Council.
However, it is expected that because of the quality and quantity of their
contributions and their expert knowledge of the Project Software and Services
that Council Members will provide useful guidance, both technical and in terms
of project direction, to potentially less experienced contributors.</p>
<p>The Steering Council and its Members play a special role in certain situations.
In particular, the Council may, if necessary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make decisions about the overall scope, vision and direction of the project.</li>
<li>Make decisions about strategic collaborations with other organizations or
  individuals.</li>
<li>Make decisions about specific technical issues, features, bugs and pull
  requests. They are the primary mechanism of guiding the code review process
  and merging pull requests.</li>
<li>Make decisions about the Services that are run by The Project and manage those
  Services for the benefit of the Project and Community.</li>
<li>Update policy documents such as this one.</li>
<li>Make decisions when regular community discussion doesn’t produce consensus on
  an issue in a reasonable time frame.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the Council's primary responsibility is to facilitate the ordinary
community-based decision making procedure described above. If we ever have to
step in and formally override the community for the health of the Project, then
we will do so, but we will consider reaching this point to indicate a failure in
our leadership.</p>
<h4 id="council-decision-making">Council decision making<a class="headerlink" href="#council-decision-making" title="Permanent link"> #</a></h4>
<p>If it becomes necessary for the Steering Council to produce a formal decision,
then they will use a form of the Apache Foundation voting process. This is a
formalized version of consensus, in which +1 votes indicate agreement, -1 votes
are vetoes (and must be accompanied with a rationale, as above), and one can
also vote fractionally (e.g. -0.5, +0.5) if one wishes to express an opinion
without registering a full veto. These numeric votes are also often used
informally as a way of getting a general sense of people's feelings on some
issue, and should not normally be taken as formal votes. A formal vote only
occurs if explicitly declared, and if this does occur then the vote should be
held open for long enough to give all interested Council Members a chance to
respond -- at least one week.</p>
<p>In practice, we anticipate that for most Steering Council decisions (e.g.,
voting in new members) a more informal process will suffice.</p>
<h4 id="council-membership">Council membership<a class="headerlink" href="#council-membership" title="Permanent link"> #</a></h4>
<p>A list of current Steering Council Members is maintained at the page About.</p>
<p>To become eligible to join the Steering Council, an individual must be a Project
Contributor who has produced contributions that are substantial in quality and
quantity, and sustained over at least six month. Potential Council Members are
nominated by existing Council members, and become members following consensus of
the existing Council members, and confirmation that the potential Member is
interested and willing to serve in that capacity. The Council will be initially
formed from the set of existing Core Developers who, as of late 2015, have been
significantly active over the last year.</p>
<p>When considering potential Members, the Council will look at candidates with a
comprehensive view of their contributions. This will include but is not limited
to code, code review, infrastructure work, mailing list and chat participation,
community help/building, education and outreach, design work, etc. We are
deliberately not setting arbitrary quantitative metrics (like “100 commits in
this repo”) to avoid encouraging behavior that plays to the metrics rather than
the project’s overall well-being. We want to encourage a diverse array of
backgrounds, viewpoints and talents in our team, which is why we explicitly do
not define code as the sole metric on which council membership will be
evaluated.</p>
<p>If a Council member becomes inactive in the project for a period of six month,
they will be considered for removal from the Council. Before removal, inactive
Member will be approached to see if they plan on returning to active
participation. If not they will be removed immediately upon a Council vote. If
they plan on returning to active participation soon, they will be given a grace
period of one month. If they don’t return to active participation within that
time period they will be removed by vote of the Council without further grace
period. All former Council members can be considered for membership again at any
time in the future, like any other Project Contributor. Retired Council members
will be listed on the project website, acknowledging the period during which
they were active in the Council.</p>
<p>The Council reserves the right to eject current Members, if they are deemed to
be actively harmful to the project’s well-being, and attempts at communication
and conflict resolution have failed. This requires the consensus of the
remaining Members.</p>
<h4 id="conflict-of-interest">Conflict of interest<a class="headerlink" href="#conflict-of-interest" title="Permanent link"> #</a></h4>
<p>It is expected that the Council Members will be employed at a wide range of
companies, universities and non-profit organizations. Because of this, it is
possible that Members will have conflict of interests, such ones include, but
are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial interests, such as investments, employment or contracting work,
  outside of The Project that may influence their work on The Project.</li>
<li>Access to proprietary information of their employer that could potentially
  leak into their work with the Project.</li>
</ul>
<p>All members of the Council shall disclose to the rest of the Council any
conflict of interest they may have. Members with a conflict of interest in a
particular issue may participate in Council discussions on that issue, but must
recuse themselves from voting on the issue.</p>
<h4 id="private-communications-of-the-council">Private communications of the Council<a class="headerlink" href="#private-communications-of-the-council" title="Permanent link"> #</a></h4>
<p>To the maximum extent possible, Council discussions and activities will be
public and done in collaboration and discussion with the Project Contributors
and Community. The Council will have a private channel on discord that will be
used sparingly and only when a specific matter requires privacy. When private
communications and decisions are needed, the Council will do its best to
summarize those to the Community after eliding personal/private/sensitive
information that should not be posted to the public internet.</p>
<h4 id="subcommittees">Subcommittees<a class="headerlink" href="#subcommittees" title="Permanent link"> #</a></h4>
<p>The Council can create subcommittees that provide leadership and guidance for
specific aspects of the project. Like the Council as a whole, subcommittees
should conduct their business in an open and public manner unless privacy is
specifically called for. Private subcommittee communications should happen on
the main private discord channel of the Council unless specifically called for.</p>
<h2 id="institutional-partners-and-funding">Institutional Partners and Funding<a class="headerlink" href="#institutional-partners-and-funding" title="Permanent link"> #</a></h2>
<p>The Steering Council are the primary leadership for the project. No outside
institution, individual or legal entity has the ability to own, control, usurp
or influence the project other than by participating in the Project as
Contributors and Council Members. However, because institutions can be an
important funding mechanism for the project, it is important to formally
acknowledge institutional participation in the project. These are Institutional
Partners.</p>
<p>An Institutional Contributor is any individual Project Contributor who
contributes to the project as part of their official duties at an Institutional
Partner. Likewise, an Institutional Council Member is any Project Steering
Council Member who contributes to the project as part of their official duties
at an Institutional Partner.</p>
<p>Institutions become eligible to become an Institutional Partner when they share
same values of Open Science Labs and are available to collaborate to the project
in any of these ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>publicizing open science labs in their social network</li>
<li>allocate one or more contributors to help Open Science Labs projects or other
  affiliated projects</li>
<li>funding Open Science Labs activities</li>
<li>offering mentoring for Open Science Labs Contributors when contributing to
  their projects (defined by the Partner).</li>
<li>offering opportunties for contracting Open Science Labs Conbributors who have
  contributed to their projects (defined by the Partner)</li>
</ul>
<p>If at some point an existing Institutional Partner doesn't accomplish with these
points mentioned above, then six month grace period begins. If at the end of
this six months period they continue not to have any contribution, then their
Institutional Partnership will lapse, and resuming it will require going through
the normal process for new Partnerships.</p>
<p>Funding acquired by Institutional Partners to work on The Project is called
Institutional Funding. However, no funding obtained by an Institutional Partner
can override the Steering Council. If a Partner has funding to do Open Science
work and the Council decides to not pursue that work as a project, the Partner
is free to pursue it on their own. However in this situation, that part of the
Partner’s work will not be under the Open Science Labs umbrella and cannot use
the Project trademarks in a way that suggests a formal relationship.</p>
<p>Institutional Partner benefits are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acknowledgement on the Open Science Labs websites and in talks.</li>
<li>Ability to influence the project through the participation of their Council
  Member.</li>
<li>Council Members invited to Open Science Labs Developer Meetings.</li>
</ul>
<p>A list of current Institutional Partners is maintained at the page About Us.</p>
