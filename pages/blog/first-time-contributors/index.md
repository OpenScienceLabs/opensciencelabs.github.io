# GIT

## What is Git?
Git is a widely used distributed version control system in software development. It allows project collaborators to work collaboratively on the same set of files, recording changes, merging contributions, and maintaining a detailed history of all modifications made to the source code.

## How to install Git?
To install Git, you can follow these steps:

1. **Windows Operating System:** You can download the Git installer from the [official Git website](https://gitforwindows.org/). Once downloaded, run the installer and follow the installation wizard instructions.

2. **macOS Operating System:** Git is usually pre-installed on macOS. However, if it's not installed or you want to update it, you can do so through the command line or using package management tools like Homebrew.

3. **Linux Operating System:** In most Linux distributions, Git is available in the default package repositories. You can install it using the package manager specific to your distribution, such as apt for Ubuntu or yum for CentOS.

For more detailed material on Git, we recommend using the Software Carpentry material, which is more focused on people who already have basic knowledge of Git but still face difficulties. You can access the material at the following link: [Software Carpentry - Git Novice](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#git-1)

## First Steps to Collaborating on a Project

### Understanding Repository Forking
When embarking on a collaborative project, the first step often involves forking a repository. Forking is a fundamental aspect of version control systems like Git, enabling individuals or teams to create their own copy of a project's repository. This copy acts as a sandbox where contributors can freely experiment, make changes, and propose improvements without affecting the original project.

#### Steps to Forking a Repository
1. **Navigate to the Repository:** Visit the project's repository on the hosting platform, such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

2. **Locate the Fork Button:** Look for the "Fork" button on the repository's page. This button is usually located in the top-right corner. Clicking it will initiate the forking process.

3. **Choose Destination:** When prompted, select where you want to fork the repository. You can fork it to your personal account or to an organization you're a part of.

4. **Wait for Forking to Complete:** The platform will create a copy of the repository in your account or organization. Depending on the size of the repository and the platform's load, this process may take a few seconds to complete.

5. **Clone Your Forked Repository:** Once the forking process is finished, clone the forked repository to your local machine using Git. This will create a local copy of the repository that you can work on.

#### Benefits of Forking a Repository
- **Independence:** Forking gives you complete control over your copy of the project. You can modify it as you see fit without impacting the original.

- **Experimentation:** Forking provides a safe environment for experimenting with changes. You can try out new features, fix bugs, or test ideas without risking the stability of the main project.

- **Collaboration:** Forking facilitates collaboration by enabling contributors to work on different aspects of the project simultaneously. Once you've made improvements or fixes in your fork, you can propose them to the original project through a pull request.


### What is a Pull Request / Merge Request and why is it important?

A Pull Request (PR) is a proposed change that a collaborator makes to a code repository managed by a version control system such as Git. It's essentially a request for the changes made in one branch of a repository to be incorporated into another branch, usually the main branch. Pull Requests are essential in the collaborative workflow of software development, as they allow teams to review, discuss, and approve changes before they are merged into the codebase. This facilitates collaboration, improves code quality, and helps maintain a clear history of modifications made to the project.

### Steps for creating a good Pull Request:

1. **Create a feature branch:** Before starting to make changes to the code, create a new branch in the repository that clearly describes the purpose of the changes you plan to make. This helps keep the development organized and makes code review easier.

2. **Make necessary changes:** Once you're on your feature branch, make the changes to the code as planned. Make sure to follow the project's coding conventions and write unit tests if necessary.

3. **Update documentation if necessary:** If your changes affect existing functionality or introduce new features, it's important to update the corresponding documentation, such as code comments or user documentation.

4. **Create the Pull Request:** Once you've completed your changes and are ready to request review, create a Pull Request. Provide a clear and concise description of the purpose of your changes, as well as any relevant context to facilitate review by your team members.

5. **Request review:** After creating the Pull Request, assign relevant reviewers to examine your changes. This may include other developers on the team, technical leads, or anyone with expertise in the area affected by your modifications.

6. **Respond to comments and make adjustments if necessary:** Once reviewers have provided feedback on your Pull Request, take the time to respond to their questions and make any necessary adjustments to your code. It's important to collaborate constructively during this process to ensure that the proposed changes are of the highest possible quality.

By following these steps, you can effectively contribute to a project's development through Pull Requests that are easy to review, approve, and merge, ultimately leading to stronger code and more efficient teamwork.


## Remotes Repositories

In version control systems like Git, a remote repository is essentially a copy of your local repository stored on a server somewhere else, often online. It acts as a central hub for collaboration and version control.


- Origin: This remote, typically created by default when cloning the repository, points to your fork on GitHub.
- Upstream: This remote points to the original (upstream) repository you forked from. It allows you to stay updated with the main project's development.


Creating the Upstream Remote

```bash
git remote add upstream <URL_of_upstream_repository>
```

Using the Upstream Remote:

Fetching Updates: Regularly use `git fetch upstream` to download the latest changes from the upstream repository without merging them into your local branch.
Creating Feature Branches: When starting work on a new feature, it's recommended to base your branch on the latest upstream main branch:

```bash
git checkout upstream/main
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```
This ensures your feature branch incorporates the most recent upstream developments.

## Understanding Merge Commit vs. Rebase in Git

In Git, managing branches is a fundamental aspect of collaboration and version control. When integrating changes from one branch to another, developers often encounter two primary methods: merge commit and rebase. Both approaches have their advantages and trade-offs, influencing how teams collaborate and maintain a clean project history. Let's delve into each method:

### Merge Commit

A merge commit, as the name suggests, involves creating a new commit to merge changes from one branch into another. Here's how it typically works:

1. **Branch Divergence**: Suppose you have a feature branch (`feature`) and a main branch (`main` or `master`). As work progresses, both branches diverge, accumulating different commits.

2. **Merge Process**: When it's time to integrate changes from `feature` into `main`, you execute a merge command. Git creates a new commit, known as a merge commit, to combine the histories of both branches.

3. **Commit History**: The merge commit preserves the entire history of changes from both branches, making it clear when and how the integration occurred.

4. **Parallel Development**: Merge commits allow parallel development, enabling team members to work independently without affecting each other's changes.

### Rebase

Rebasing is an alternative method for integrating changes, involving rewriting commit history to maintain a linear project history. Here's how it differs from merge commit:

1. **Branch Adjustment**: Instead of creating a merge commit, rebasing adjusts the commit history of the feature branch (`feature`) to appear as if it originated from the tip of the main branch (`main` or `master`).

2. **Commit Replay**: Git replays each commit from the feature branch onto the tip of the main branch, effectively transplanting the changes onto a different base.

3. **Linear History**: By rewriting commit history, rebasing creates a linear sequence of commits, making the project history cleaner and easier to follow.

4. **Conflict Resolution**: Rebasing can lead to conflicts if changes from the feature branch conflict with those on the main branch. These conflicts must be resolved manually during the rebase process.

 Recommendations and Best Practices

While both merge commit and rebase have their merits, the choice often depends on the team's workflow and preferences. Here are some considerations:

**Merge Commit**:

* Suitable for preserving a detailed history of parallel development.
* Preferred when collaboration involves multiple contributors or when maintaining a clear record of individual contributions is essential.

**Rebase**:

  - Promotes a cleaner, linear project history.
  - Recommended for feature branches with short-lived changes or when maintaining a tidy commit history is a priority.

It's worth noting that some organizations, such as the Open Source Initiative (OSI), recommend the usage of git rebase to maintain a clean and linear project history. You can configure Git to use rebase by default for pull operations with the command:

```bash
$ git config --global pull.rebase true
```

OSL recommends the usage of git rebase


## Mergin a Pull Requests (PRs)
Pull requests (PRs) are essential for collaborative software development, enabling contributors to propose changes to a project's codebase. Once a PR is submitted, it undergoes a review process before being merged into the main codebase. Here are three common methods for merging PRs:

#### 1. Merge Commit:
A merge commit combines changes from different branches in version control systems like Git. It records the integration of these changes, preserving their histories and keeping the project's development organized.

Use when you want to keep a detailed history of changes from multiple branches. It preserves individual commit histories, making it suitable for tracking the development of feature branches and bug fixes separately.


#### 2. Squash and Merge:
"Squash and merge" condenses multiple commits into one before merging, simplifying the project's commit history.

Employ when you have multiple small, related commits that you want to consolidate into a single, more meaningful commit. It's useful for cleaning up the commit history, especially before merging feature branches into the main branch.

#### 3. Rebase and Merge:
"Rebase and merge" rewrites commit history to integrate changes from one branch into another, maintaining a cleaner and more linear history.

Opt for this method when you want to maintain a clean and linear commit history by incorporating changes from one branch into another. It helps to avoid unnecessary merge commits, keeping the commit history straightforward and easier to follow.


Each method offers distinct advantages and considerations, influencing the project's commit history and overall workflow.

In their development workflow, **Open Science Labs** recommend using squash and merge.

### Pre-commit

Pre-commit is a tool used in software development to automatically run various checks and tests on files before they are committed to a version control system, such as Git. These checks can include code formatting, linting, static analysis, and other quality assurance tasks. The goal is to catch potential issues early in the development process, ensuring that only high-quality code is committed to the repository.

Here's how to install and use pre-commit:

1. Installation:
You can install pre-commit using pip, the Python package manager. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

``` bash
$ pip install pre-commit
```

2. Configuration:
Once pre-commit is installed, you need to set up a configuration file named .pre-commit-config.yaml in the root directory of your project. This file specifies the hooks (checks) that pre-commit should run.

Here's a basic example of a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file:

``` yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v3.3.0
    hooks:
      - id: trailing-whitespace
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: check-yaml
```

3. Installation of Git Hooks:
After configuring `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, you need to install pre-commit hooks into your Git repository. Navigate to your project directory in the terminal and run:

``` bash
$ pre-commit install
```

4. Running Pre-commit:
Once the pre-commit hooks are installed, you can run them manually using the following command:

```bash
$ pre-commit run --all-files
```
This command tells pre-commit to run all configured hooks on all files in the repository. It will check for issues according to the configuration specified in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and provide feedback on any problems found.


The Git hooks are triggered each time the user initiates a git commit command. By default, they operate on the files that have been modified, but their behavior can be adjusted to encompass all files if configured accordingly in the .pre-commit-config.yaml file.

## Navigating Git Workflows: A Dive into GitHub Flow and GitFlow

In the ever-evolving world of software development, efficient collaboration and streamlined workflows are paramount. Git, the popular version control system, offers a plethora of options for managing code changes, each tailored to different team structures and project requirements. Two widely used workflows, GitHub Flow and GitFlow, stand out for their simplicity and effectiveness. Let's explore these options in detail.

### GitHub Flow:

GitHub Flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow specifically designed for teams using GitHub for version control. It emphasizes simplicity and continuous delivery, making it an ideal choice for projects with frequent releases and rapid iteration cycles. Here's a breakdown of its key features:

**Branching Model:**

   - Main Branch: GitHub Flow revolves around a single main branch (often named "main" or "master"), representing the development branch that leads to production-ready code.
   - Feature Branches: Developers create feature branches off the main branch for each new feature or bug fix.


**Workflow:**

- Create a Branch: Developers create a new branch for each feature or bug fix.
- Make Changes: Developers create a new branch, with the latest changes from upstream/main (or origin/main, if you are not working on a fork) for each feature or bug fix.
- Open Pull Request: Once changes are complete, a pull request (PR) is opened to merge the feature branch into the main branch.
- Review and Merge: Team members review the code changes, provide feedback, and merge the PR into the main branch once approved.

**Continuous Deployment**:

- Continuous Integration: GitHub Flow encourages the use of continuous integration tools to automatically test changes before merging.
- Continuous Deployment: Merged changes are automatically deployed to production, ensuring a fast and reliable release cycle.

GitHub Flow's simplicity and flexibility make it a popular choice for teams of all sizes, particularly those embracing agile development practices.

### GitFlow:

GitFlow, developed by Vincent Driessen, provides a more organized approach to branching and release management. It excels in larger projects with longer release cycles and strict versioning requirements. Here's how GitFlow differs from GitHub Flow:

**Branching Model**:

- Main Branches: GitFlow defines two main branches – "master" for stable releases and "develop" for ongoing development.
- Feature Branches: Developers create feature branches off the "develop" branch for each new feature.

**Workflow**:

- Feature Development: Developers work on feature branches, merging them into the "develop" branch once complete.
- Release Branches: When it's time for a new release, a release branch is created from the "develop" branch for final testing and bug fixing.
- Hotfix Branches: If critical issues arise in production, hotfix branches are created from the "master" branch to address them directly.

**Versioning**:

- GitFlow employs a strict versioning scheme, with each release assigned a unique version number based on semantic versioning principles.

### Which Workflow to Choose?

Choosing between GitHub Flow and GitFlow depends on your team's specific needs and project requirements:

- **GitHub Flow**: Ideal for teams focused on continuous delivery, rapid iteration, and simplicity. This is most used in a bunch of projects.
- **GitFlow**: Suited for larger projects with longer release cycles, strict versioning, and a more structured approach to development.

While both workflows have their merits, it's essential to assess your team's workflow preferences, project size, and release cycle frequency before making a decision.

# What is a virtual enviroment and why is it important?

A virtual environment is a self-contained directory that isolates the dependencies for a specific project, regardless of the programming language. It can house an interpreter (like Python) along with its associated libraries, but it can also manage dependencies for other languages and tools. This isolation ensures that the project's requirements don't conflict with those of other projects on the same system.

When you create a virtual environment for each of your projects, it essentially creates a sandboxed environment where you can install packages and dependencies without affecting the global Python installation on your system. This isolation is crucial because different projects often require different versions of libraries or dependencies, and conflicts can arise if they share the same environment.

Creating virtual environments is crucial for several reasons:

- **Isolation:** Virtual environments allow you to isolate project dependencies, preventing conflicts between different projects that may require different versions of the same packages. This ensures that your projects remain stable and reproducible.

- **Dependency Management:** By creating separate environments for each project, you can manage dependencies more effectively. You can install specific versions of packages for each project without affecting other projects or the system-wide installation.

- **Experimentation:** Virtual environments provide a safe space for experimentation. You can try out new packages or versions without worrying about breaking existing projects or the system environment.

- **Reproducibility:** Utilizing virtual environments not only streamlines collaboration but also enhances reproducibility in project workflows. By sharing environment configuration files such as environment.yml, collaborators ensure uniformity in dependencies and versions across all team members. This practice mitigates compatibility issues and fosters consistency, enabling seamless replication of results and facilitating smoother collaboration.
