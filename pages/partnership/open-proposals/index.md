# Open Proposals

Welcome to the Open Proposals page of Open Science Labs (OSL). This page serves
as a central hub for proposals aimed at addressing common challenges across our
communities and organizations. Here, we publish ideas that have the potential to
be developed in partnership with other communities, institutes, or interested
partners.

Proposals on this page may originate from OSL or from our partner organizations,
and they are intended to foster collaborative solutions that benefit the broader
open science and technology ecosystem. Each proposal will remain open for
discussion and feedback for one year. If a proposal does not generate sufficient
interest within that period, it will be closed to focus our efforts on active
and promising initiatives.

We invite all partners and interested organizations to review these proposals,
share your feedback, and consider collaboration on projects that can drive
meaningful impact.
