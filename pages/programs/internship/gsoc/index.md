# Google Summer of Code (GSoC) with Open Science Labs: Participation Plan

## Google Summer of Code (GSoC)

Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on bringing more student
developers into open source software development. GSoC invites students to work
with an open source organization on a 3-month programming project during their
break from school.

## Open Science Labs' Participation in GSoC

At Open Science Labs (OSL), we are excited to announce our plans to participate
in the upcoming Google Summer of Code. This represents a significant step for us
in fostering open science and technology, as well as providing an exceptional
learning and development platform for student developers around the world. Our
participation in GSoC aligns perfectly with our mission to support and grow the
open source community through meaningful and innovative projects.

## Our Project Ideas for GSoC

We have carefully curated a list of project ideas that not only align with our
vision at OSL but also offer challenging and rewarding experiences for student
developers. These projects span a range of topics and technologies, ensuring
there's something to engage every interested student. Below is an initial list
of project ideas we plan to submit for GSoC. We believe these projects offer an
excellent opportunity for students to contribute to significant open source
initiatives while enhancing their skills and knowledge under the guidance of
experienced mentors.
