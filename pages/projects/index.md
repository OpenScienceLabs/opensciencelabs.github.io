# Open Science Labs Programs

Open Science Labs (OSL) is dedicated to fostering innovation and collaboration within the open science and open-source communities. Our mission is to create a supportive environment where technology meets scientific inquiry, enabling researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to contribute to and benefit from open science. Currently, OSL offers the following cornerstone programs designed to facilitate this mission:

## Incubator Program

The **Incubator Program** at OSL is crafted to nurture open-source projects with a focus on scientific research and development. This program offers resources, mentorship, and a community platform for projects at their nascent stages, helping them to grow and thrive. By providing these projects with the support they need, we aim to accelerate their development and increase their impact within the scientific community. Participants in the Incubator Program gain access to a network of mentors and collaborators, along with exposure to best practices in open-source development and scientific research.

## Internship Program

Parallelly, the **Internship Program** is designed to connect talented individuals with projects under the OSL umbrella, including those within the Incubator Program. This initiative is inspired by the successful format of the Google Summer of Code, focusing on providing real-world experience to students and early-career professionals. Through this program, interns work closely with mentors on meaningful contributions to open-source projects, gaining hands-on experience, enhancing their skills, and making significant advancements in their professional development. The Internship Program is an invaluable opportunity for both personal growth and for contributing to the broader goals of open science.
